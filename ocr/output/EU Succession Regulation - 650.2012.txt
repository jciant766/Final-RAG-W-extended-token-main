## REGULATION  (EU)  No  650/2012  OF  THE  EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT  AND  OF  THE  COUNCIL of  4  July  2012

on  jurisdiction,  applicable  law,  recognition  and  enforcement  of  decisions  and  acceptance  and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and on the creation of a European  Certificate  of  Succession

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN  UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  and  in  particular  Article  81(2)  thereof, to  the  Council,  was  adopted  on  30  November  2000. That programme identifies measures relating to the harmonisation of conflict-of-laws rules as measures facili­ tating  the  mutual  recognition  of  decisions,  and  provides for  the  drawing-up of  an  instrument  relating  to  wills  and succession.

Having  regard  to  the  proposal  from  the  European  Commission,

Having  regard  to  the  opinion  of  the  European  Economic  and Social  Committee (  1  ),

Acting  in  accordance  with  the  ordinary  legislative  procedure (  2 ),

Whereas:

- (1) The  Union  has  set  itself  the  objective  of  maintaining  and developing  an  area  of  freedom,  security  and  justice  in which  the  free  movement  of  persons  is  ensured.  For the  gradual  establishment  of  such  an  area,  the  Union  is to  adopt  measures relating  to  judicial cooperation in  civil matters having cross-border implications, particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal  market.
- (2) In accordance  with  point  (c) of Article 81(2) of the Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union,  such measures  may  include  measures  aimed  at  ensuring  the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning  conflict  of  laws  and  of  jurisdiction.
- (3) The  European  Council  meeting  in  Tampere  on  15  and 16 October 1999 endorsed the principle of mutual recognition  of  judgments  and  other  decisions  of  judicial authorities  as  the  cornerstone  of  judicial  cooperation  in civil matters and invited the Council and the Commission to  adopt  a  programme  of  measures  to  implement  that principle.
- (4) A  programme  of  measures  for  implementation  of  the principle  of  mutual  recognition  of  decisions  in  civil  and commercial matters (  3  ),  common  to  the  Commission  and

( 1 )  OJ  C  44,  11.2.2011,  p.  148.

(  2  )  Position  of  the  European  Parliament  of  13  March  2012  (not  yet published  in  the  Official  Journal)  and  decision  of  the  Council  of 7  June  2012.

( 3 )  OJ  C  12,  15.1.2001,  p.  1.

- (5) The  European  Council  meeting  in  Brussels  on  4  and 5  November  2004  adopted  a  new  programme  called 'The  Hague  Programme:  strengthening  freedom,  security and  justice  in  the  European  Union' (  4  ).  That  programme underlines  the  need  to  adopt  an  instrument  in  matters  of succession  dealing,  in  particular,  with  the  questions  of conflict of laws, jurisdiction, mutual recognition and enforcement  of  decisions  in  the  area  of  succession  and a  European  Certificate  of  Succession.
- (6) At  its  meeting  in  Brussels  on  10  and  11  December  2009 the European Council adopted a new multiannual programme  called 'The Stockholm Programme  An open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens' (  5  ).  In  that  programme  the  European  Council considered  that  mutual  recognition  should  be  extended to  fields  that  are  not  yet  covered  but  are  essential  to everyday  life,  for  example  succession  and  wills,  while taking  into  consideration  Member  States'  legal  systems, including public policy ( ordre public ), and national traditions  in  this  area.
- (7) The  proper  functioning  of  the  internal  market  should  be facilitated by removing the obstacles to the free movement  of  persons  who  currently  face  difficulties  in asserting their rights in the context of a succession having  cross-border  implications.  In  the  European  area of justice, citizens must be able to organise their succession  in  advance.  The  rights  of  heirs  and  legatees, of  other  persons close to  the deceased and of creditors of the  succession  must  be  effectively  guaranteed.
- (8) In order to achieve those objectives, this Regulation should bring together provisions on jurisdiction, on applicable  law,  on  recognition  or,  as  the  case  may  be, acceptance,  enforceability  and  enforcement  of  decisions, authentic  instruments  and  court  settlements  and  on  the creation  of  a  European  Certificate  of  Succession.

- (9) The  scope  of  this  Regulation  should  include  all  civil-law aspects  of  succession  to  the  estate  of  a  deceased  person, namely all forms of transfer of assets, rights and obligations  by  reason  of  death,  whether  by  way  of  a voluntary  transfer  under  a  disposition  of  property  upon death  or  a  transfer  through  intestate  succession.
- (10) This  Regulation  should  not  apply  to  revenue  matters  or to administrative matters of a public-law nature. It should therefore  be  for  national  law  to  determine,  for  instance, how  taxes  and  other  liabilities  of  a  public-law  nature  are calculated  and  paid,  whether  these  be  taxes  payable  by the deceased at the time of death or any type of succession-related  tax  to  be  paid  by  the  estate  or  the beneficiaries. It should also be for national law to determine  whether  the  release  of  succession  property  to beneficiaries  under  this  Regulation  or  the  recording  of succession  property  in  a  register  may  be  made  subject to  the  payment  of  taxes.
- (11) This  Regulation  should  not  apply  to  areas  of  civil  law other than succession. For reasons of clarity, a number of questions  which  could  be  seen  as  having  a  link  with matters of succession should be explicitly excluded from  the  scope  of  this  Regulation.
- (12) Accordingly, this Regulation should not apply to questions relating to matrimonial property regimes, including  marriage  settlements  as  known  in  some  legal systems  to  the  extent  that  such  settlements  do  not  deal with  succession  matters,  and  property  regimes  of  rela­ tionships deemed to have comparable effects to marriage.  The  authorities  dealing  with  a  given  succession under  this  Regulation  should  nevertheless,  depending  on the  situation,  take  into  account  the  winding-up  of  the matrimonial  property  regime  or  similar  property  regime of the deceased  when  determining the estate of the deceased  and  the  respective  shares  of  the  beneficiaries.
- (13) Questions  relating  to  the  creation,  administration  and dissolution  of  trusts  should  also  be  excluded  from  the scope  of  this  Regulation.  This  should  not  be  understood as  a  general  exclusion  of  trusts.  Where  a  trust  is  created under a will or under statute in connection with intestate succession the law applicable to the succession under this Regulation  should  apply  with  respect  to  the  devolution of  the  assets  and  the  determination  of  the  beneficiaries.
- (14) Property rights,  interests  and  assets  created  or  transferred otherwise  than  by  succession,  for  instance  by  way  of gifts,  should  also  be  excluded  from  the  scope  of  this Regulation.  However,  it  should  be  the  law  specified  by this  Regulation  as  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession which determines whether gifts or other forms of dispositions inter  vivos giving  rise  to  a  right in  rem prior to  death  should  be  restored  or  accounted  for  for  the

purposes of  determining the shares of the beneficiaries in accordance  with  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession.

- (15) This  Regulation  should  allow  for  the  creation  or the transfer by succession of a right in immovable or movable  property  as  provided  for  in  the  law  applicable to the succession. It should,  however,  not affect the limited number (' numerus clausus ') of rights in rem known  in  the  national  law  of  some  Member  States.  A Member State should not be required to recognise a right in  rem relating  to  property  located  in  that  Member  State if  the  right in  rem in  question  is  not  known  in  its  law.
- (16) However,  in  order  to  allow  the  beneficiaries  to  enjoy  in another Member State the rights which have been created or transferred to them  by  succession,  this  Regulation should  provide  for  the  adaptation  of  an  unknown  right in  rem to  the  closest  equivalent right in  rem under  the  law of  that  other  Member  State.  In  the  context  of  such  an adaptation,  account  should  be  taken  of  the  aims  and  the interests  pursued  by  the  specific  right in  rem and  the effects  attached  to  it.  For  the  purposes  of  determining the closest equivalent national right in  rem ,  the  authorities or  competent  persons  of  the  State  whose  law  applied  to the  succession  may  be  contacted  for  further  information on  the  nature  and  the  effects  of  the  right.  To  that  end, the  existing  networks  in  the  area  of  judicial  cooperation in  civil  and  commercial  matters  could  be  used,  as  well  as any  other  available  means  facilitating  the  understanding of  foreign  law.
- (17) The  adaptation  of  unknown  rights in  rem as  explicitly provided for by this Regulation should not preclude other  forms  of  adaptation  in  the  context  of  the  appli­ cation  of  this  Regulation.
- (18) The requirements for the recording in a register of a right in  immovable  or  movable  property  should  be  excluded from  the  scope  of  this  Regulation.  It  should  therefore  be the  law  of  the  Member  State  in  which the  register is  kept (for immovable property, the lex rei sitae ) which determines  under  what  legal  conditions  and  how  the recording  must  be  carried  out and  which  authorities, such as land registers or notaries, are in charge of checking that all requirements are met and that the docu­ mentation presented or established is sufficient or contains the necessary information. In particular, the authorities  may  check  that  the  right  of  the  deceased  to the succession property mentioned in the document presented  for  registration  is  a  right  which  is  recorded as  such  in  the  register  or  which  is  otherwise  demon­ strated  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  the  Member  State in  which  the  register  is  kept.  In  order  to  avoid  dupli­ cation  of  documents,  the  registration  authorities  should accept  such  documents  drawn  up  in  another  Member State  by  the  competent  authorities  whose  circulation  is provided for by this Regulation. In particular, the European Certificate of Succession issued under this

Regulation  should  constitute  a  valid  document  for  the recording of succession property in a register of a Member  State.  This  should  not  preclude  the  authorities involved in the registration from asking the person applying for registration to provide such additional information,  or  to  present  such  additional  documents, as  are  required  under  the  law  of  the  Member  State  in which  the  register  is  kept,  for  instance  information  or documents relating to the payment of revenue. The competent authority may indicate to the person applying  for  registration  how  the  missing  information or  documents  can  be  provided.

- (19) The effects of the recording of a right in a register should also  be  excluded  from  the  scope  of  this  Regulation.  It should  therefore  be the law  of the  Member  State  in which  the register is kept  which  determines  whether the  recording  is,  for  instance,  declaratory  or  constitutive in  effect.  Thus,  where,  for  example,  the  acquisition  of  a right  in  immovable  property  requires  a  recording  in  a register  under  the  law  of  the  Member  State  in  which the  register  is  kept  in  order  to  ensure  the erga  omnes effect of registers  or  to  protect  legal  transactions,  the moment  of  such  acquisition  should  be  governed  by  the law  of  that  Member  State.
- (20) This  Regulation  should  respect  the  different  systems  for dealing with matters of succession applied in the Member States. For  the  purposes  of this  Regulation,  the  term 'court'  should  therefore  be  given  a  broad  meaning  so as  to  cover  not  only  courts  in  the  true  sense  of  the word,  exercising  judicial  functions,  but  also  the  notaries or  registry  offices  in  some  Member  States  who  or  which, in certain matters of succession, exercise judicial functions  like  courts,  and  the  notaries  and  legal  profes­ sionals  who,  in  some  Member  States,  exercise  judicial functions  in  a  given  succession  by  delegation  of  power by a court. All courts as defined in this Regulation should  be  bound  by  the  rules  of  jurisdiction  set  out  in this  Regulation.  Conversely,  the  term  'court'  should  not cover non-judicial authorities of a Member State empowered  under  national  law  to  deal  with  matters  of succession,  such  as  the  notaries  in  most  Member  States where,  as  is usually  the case,  they  are  not  exercising judicial  functions.
- (21) This Regulation should allow all notaries who  have competence  in matters of succession  in  the  Member States  to  exercise  such  competence.  Whether  or  not  the notaries  in  a  given  Member  State  are  bound  by  the  rules of  jurisdiction  set  out  in  this  Regulation  should  depend on  whether  or  not  they  are  covered  by  the  term  'court' for  the  purposes  of  this  Regulation.
- (22) Acts  issued  by  notaries  in  matters  of  succession  in  the Member  States  should  circulate  under  this  Regulation. When notaries exercise judicial functions they are bound  by  the  rules  of jurisdiction,  and  the decisions they give should circulate in accordance with the provisions on recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions. When notaries do not exercise  judicial  functions  they  are  not  bound  by  the

rules  of  jurisdiction,  and  the  authentic  instruments  they issue  should  circulate  in  accordance  with  the  provisions on  authentic  instruments.

- (23) In  view  of  the  increasing  mobility  of  citizens  and  in order to ensure the proper administration of justice within the Union and to ensure that a genuine connecting  factor  exists  between  the  succession  and  the Member  State in which  jurisdiction is exercised, this Regulation  should  provide  that  the  general  connecting factor  for  the  purposes  of  determining  both  jurisdiction and  the  applicable  law  should  be  the  habitual  residence of the deceased at the time of death. In order to determine  the  habitual  residence,  the  authority  dealing with  the  succession  should  make  an  overall  assessment of  the  circumstances  of  the  life  of  the  deceased  during the  years  preceding  his  death  and  at  the  time  of  his death,  taking  account  of  all  relevant  factual  elements,  in particular  the  duration  and  regularity  of  the  deceased's presence  in  the  State  concerned  and  the  conditions  and reasons  for  that  presence.  The  habitual  residence  thus determined  should  reveal  a  close  and  stable  connection with  the  State  concerned  taking  into  account  the  specific aims  of  this  Regulation.
- (24) In certain cases, determining the deceased's habitual residence  may  prove  complex.  Such  a  case  may  arise, in particular, where  the deceased for professional or economic  reasons had gone to live abroad to  work there,  sometimes  for  a  long  time,  but  had  maintained  a close  and  stable  connection  with  his  State  of  origin.  In such a case, the deceased could, depending on the circumstances  of  the  case,  be  considered  still  to  have his  habitual  residence  in  his  State  of  origin  in  which the  centre  of  interests  of  his  family  and  his  social  life was  located.  Other  complex  cases  may  arise  where  the deceased  lived  in  several  States  alternately  or  travelled from  one  State  to  another  without  settling  permanently in  any  of  them.  If  the  deceased  was  a  national  of  one  of those  States  or  had  all  his  main  assets  in  one  of  those States, his nationality or the location of those assets could  be  a  special  factor  in  the  overall  assessment  of all  the  factual  circumstances.
- (25) With regard to the determination of the law applicable to the  succession  the  authority  dealing  with  the  succession may  in exceptional cases -where, for instance, the deceased had moved to the State of his habitual residence fairly recently before his death and all the circumstances of  the  case  indicate  that  he  was  manifestly more closely connected with another State - arrive at the conclusion that the law applicable to the succession should not be the law of the State of the habitual residence of the deceased but rather the law of the State with which the deceased was manifestly more closely connected. That manifestly closest connection should, however, not be resorted to as a subsidiary connecting factor whenever  the determination of the habitual  residence  of  the  deceased  at  the  time  of  death proves  complex.

- (26) Nothing  in  this  Regulation  should  prevent  a  court  from applying  mechanisms  designed  to  tackle  the  evasion  of the  law,  such  as fraude  à  la  loi in  the  context  of  private international  law.
- (27) The  rules  of  this  Regulation  are  devised  so  as  to  ensure that  the  authority  dealing  with  the  succession  will,  in most situations, be applying its own law. This Regulation therefore provides for a series  of  mechanisms  which would  come  into  play  where  the  deceased  had  chosen as  the  law  to  govern  his  succession  the  law  of  a  Member State  of  which  he  was  a  national.
- (28) One  such  mechanism  should  be  to  allow  the  parties concerned  to  conclude  a  choice-of-court  agreement  in favour of the courts of the Member State of the chosen  law.  It  would  have  to  be  determined  on  a  caseby-case basis, depending in particular on the issue covered  by  the  choice-of-court  agreement,  whether  the agreement would have to be concluded between all parties  concerned  by  the  succession  or  whether  some of  them  could  agree  to  bring  a  specific  issue  before  the chosen  court  in  a  situation  where  the  decision  by  that court  on  that  issue  would  not  affect  the  rights  of  the other  parties  to  the  succession.
- (29) If  succession  proceedings  are  opened  by  a  court  of  its own motion, as is the case in certain Member States, that court  should  close  the  proceedings  if  the  parties  agree  to settle the succession amicably out of court in the Member  State of the chosen law.  Where succession proceedings are not opened by a court of its  own motion,  this  Regulation  should  not  prevent  the  parties from  settling  the  succession  amicably  out  of  court,  for instance  before  a  notary,  in  a  Member  State  of  their choice where  this is possible under the law of that Member  State.  This  should  be  the  case  even  if  the  law applicable to the succession is not the law of that Member  State.
- (30) In  order  to  ensure  that  the  courts  of  all  Member  States may, on the same grounds, exercise jurisdiction in relation to the succession of persons not habitually resident  in  a  Member  State  at  the  time  of  death,  this Regulation should list exhaustively, in a hierarchical order,  the  grounds  on  which  such  subsidiary  jurisdiction may  be  exercised.
- (31) In  order  to  remedy,  in  particular,  situations  of  denial  of justice,  this  Regulation  should  provide  a forum  necessitatis allowing  a  court  of  a  Member  State,  on  an  exceptional basis,  to  rule  on  a  succession  which  is  closely  connected with  a  third  State.  Such  an  exceptional  basis  may  be deemed  to  exist  when  proceedings  prove  impossible  in the  third  State  in  question,  for  example  because  of  civil

war, or when a beneficiary cannot reasonably be expected to initiate or conduct proceedings in that State. Jurisdiction based on forum necessitatis should, however,  be  exercised  only  if  the  case  has  a  sufficient connection  with  the  Member  State  of  the  court  seised.

- (32) In order to simplify the lives of heirs and legatees habitually  resident  in  a  Member  State  other  than  that in  which  the  succession  is  being  or  will  be  dealt  with, this  Regulation  should  allow  any  person  entitled  under the  law  applicable to  the  succession  to  make  declarations concerning the acceptance or waiver of the succession, of a  legacy  or  of  a  reserved  share,  or  concerning  the  limi­ tation  of  his  liability  for  the  debts  under  the  succession, to  make  such  declarations  in  the  form  provided  for  by the  law  of  the  Member  State  of  his  habitual  residence before  the  courts  of  that  Member  State.  This  should  not preclude such declarations being made before other auth­ orities  in  that  Member  State  which  are  competent  to receive declarations under national law. Persons choosing  to  avail  themselves  of  the  possibility  to  make declarations in the Member State of their habitual residence should themselves inform the court or authority  which  is  or  will  be  dealing  with  the  succession of  the  existence  of  such  declarations  within  any  time limit  set  by  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession.
- (33) It  should  not  be  possible  for  a  person  who  wishes  to limit  his  liability  for  the  debts  under  the  succession to  do so  by  a  mere  declaration  to  that  effect  before  the  courts or  other  competent  authorities  of  the  Member  State  of his  habitual  residence  where  the  law  applicable  to  the succession requires him to initiate specific legal proceedings,  for  instance  inventory  proceedings,  before the competent court. A declaration made in such circum­ stances  by  a  person  in  the  Member  State  of  his  habitual residence  in  the  form  provided  for  by  the  law  of  that Member  State  should  therefore  not  be  formally  valid  for the purposes of this Regulation. Nor should the documents  instituting  the  legal  proceedings  be  regarded as  declarations  for  the  purposes  of  this  Regulation.
- (34) In  the  interests  of  the  harmonious  functioning  of  justice, the  giving  of  irreconcilable  decisions  in  different  Member States  should  be  avoided.  To  that  end,  this  Regulation should  provide  for  general  procedural  rules  similar  to those  of  other  Union  instruments  in  the  area  of  judicial cooperation  in  civil  matters.
- (35) One  such  procedural  rule  is  a lis  pendens rule  which  will come  into  play  if  the  same  succession  case  is  brought before  different  courts  in  different  Member  States.  That rule  will  then  determine  which  court  should  proceed  to deal  with  the  succession  case.

- (36) Given  that  succession  matters  in  some  Member  States may  be  dealt  with  by  non-judicial  authorities,  such  as notaries,  who  are  not  bound  by  the  rules  of  jurisdiction under  this Regulation,  it cannot  be  excluded  that  an amicable  out-of-court  settlement  and  court  proceedings relating  to  the  same  succession,  or  two  amicable  out-ofcourt settlements relating to the same succession, may be initiated  in  parallel  in  different  Member  States.  In  such  a situation,  it  should  be  for  the  parties  involved,  once  they become aware of the parallel proceedings, to agree among themselves how to proceed. If they cannot agree,  the  succession  would  have  to  be  dealt  with  and decided upon by the courts having jurisdiction under this Regulation.
- (37) In  order  to  allow  citizens  to  avail  themselves,  with  all legal certainty,  of the benefits offered  by  the  internal market,  this  Regulation  should  enable  them  to  know  in advance which law will apply to their succession. Harmonised  conflict-of-laws  rules  should  be  introduced in  order  to  avoid  contradictory  results.  The  main  rule should ensure that the succession is governed by a predictable  law  with  which  it  is  closely  connected.  For reasons  of  legal  certainty  and  in  order  to  avoid  the  frag­ mentation  of  the  succession,  that  law  should  govern  the succession  as  a  whole,  that  is  to  say,  all  of  the  property forming  part  of  the  estate,  irrespective  of  the  nature  of the assets and regardless of whether the assets are located in  another  Member  State  or  in  a  third  State.
- (38) This  Regulation  should  enable  citizens  to  organise  their succession  in  advance  by  choosing  the  law  applicable  to their succession. That choice should be limited to the law of a State of their nationality in order to ensure a connection  between  the  deceased  and  the  law  chosen and  to  avoid  a  law  being  chosen  with  the  intention  of frustrating  the  legitimate  expectations  of  persons  entitled to  a  reserved  share.
- (39) A choice of law should be made expressly in a declaration in the form  of a disposition of property upon  death  or  be  demonstrated  by  the  terms  of  such  a disposition. A choice of law could be regarded as demon­ strated  by  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death  where, for  instance,  the  deceased  had  referred  in  his  disposition to specific provisions  of the law  of the State of his nationality  or  where  he  had  otherwise  mentioned  that law.
- (40) A  choice  of  law  under  this  Regulation  should  be  valid even  if  the  chosen  law  does  not  provide  for  a  choice  of law  in  matters  of  succession.  It  should  however  be  for the  chosen  law  to  determine  the  substantive  validity  of the  act  of  making  the  choice,  that  is  to  say,  whether  the person  making  the  choice  may  be  considered  to  have understood  and  consented  to  what  he  was  doing.  The same should  apply to  the  act  of  modifying  or  revoking  a choice  of  law.
- (41) For  the  purposes  of  the  application  of  this  Regulation, the determination of the nationality or the multiple nationalities of a person should be resolved as a preliminary  question.  The  issue  of  considering  a  person as  a  national  of  a  State  falls  outside  the  scope  of  this Regulation and is subject to national law, including, where applicable, international Conventions, in full observance  of the general principles  of  the  European Union.
- (42) The law determined as the law applicable to the succession should govern the succession from the opening  of  the  succession  to  the  transfer  of  ownership of  the  assets  forming  part  of  the  estate  to  the  bene­ ficiaries  as  determined  by  that  law.  It  should  include questions relating to the administration of the estate and  to  liability  for  the  debts  under  the  succession.  The payment of the debts under the succession may, depending,  in  particular,  on  the  law  applicable  to  the succession,  include  the  taking  into  account  of  a  specific ranking  of  the  creditors.
- (43) The  rules  of  jurisdiction  laid  down  by  this  Regulation may,  in certain cases, lead to a situation where  the court  having  jurisdiction  to  rule  on  the  succession  will not  be  applying  its  own  law.  When  that  situation  occurs in  a  Member State whose law provides for the mandatory appointment of an administrator of  the  estate, this  Regu­ lation  should  allow  the  courts  of  that  Member  State, when seised, to appoint one or more such administrators under their own law. This should be without prejudice to any  choice  made  by  the  parties  to  settle  the  succession amicably  out  of  court  in  another  Member  State  where this  is  possible  under  the  law  of  that  Member  State.  In order  to  ensure  a  smooth  coordination  between  the  law applicable  to  the  succession  and  the  law  of  the  Member State  of  the  appointing  court,  the  court  should  appoint the  person(s)  who  would  be  entitled  to  administer  the estate  under  the  law  applicable to  the  succession,  such  as for  instance  the  executor  of  the  will  of  the  deceased  or the heirs themselves  or, if the law applicable to the succession  so  requires,  a  third-party  administrator.  The courts  may,  however,  in  specific  cases  where  their  law so  requires, appoint a  third  party as  administrator  even  if this  is  not  provided  for  in  the  law  applicable  to  the succession.  If  the  deceased  had  appointed  an  executor of the will,  that  person  may  not  be  deprived  of  his powers unless the law applicable to the succession allows  for  the  termination  of  his  mandate.
- (44) The  powers  exercised  by  the  administrators  appointed  in the Member  State  of  the court seised  should  be the powers of administration which they may exercise under  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession.  Thus,  if,  for instance, the heir is  appointed as  administrator he should have  the  powers  to  administer  the  estate  which  an  heir

would have under that law. Where the powers of admin­ istration which may be exercised under the law applicable to the succession are not sufficient to preserve  the  assets  of  the  estate  or  to  protect  the  rights of  the  creditors  or  of  other  persons  having  guaranteed the  debts  of  the  deceased,  the  administrator(s)  appointed in the  Member  State  of the court seised  may,  on  a residual  basis,  exercise  powers  of  administration  to  that end  provided  for  by  the  law  of  that  Member  State.  Such residual powers could include, for instance, establishing a list  of  the  assets  of  the  estate  and  the  debts  under  the succession,  informing  creditors  of  the  opening  of  the succession and inviting them to make their claims known,  and  taking  any  provisional,  including  protective, measures  intended  to  preserve  the  assets  of  the  estate. The acts performed by an administrator in exercise of the residual  powers  should  respect  the  law  applicable  to  the succession as regards the transfer of ownership of succession  property,  including  any  transaction  entered into  by  the  beneficiaries  prior  to  the  appointment  of the administrator, liability for the debts under the succession  and  the  rights  of  the  beneficiaries,  including, where  applicable,  the  right  to  accept  or  to  waive  the succession.  Such acts could, for instance, only entail the  alienation  of  assets  or  the  payment  of  debts  where this  would  be  allowed  under  the  law  applicable  to  the succession. Where under the law applicable to the succession the appointment  of a third-party  adminis­ trator  changes  the  liability  of  the  heirs,  such  a  change of  liability  should  be  respected.

- (45) This Regulation should not preclude creditors, for instance through a representative, from taking such further  steps  as  may  be  available  under  national  law, where applicable, in accordance with the relevant Union  instruments,  in  order  to  safeguard  their  rights.
- (46) This  Regulation  should  allow  for  potential  creditors  in other Member  States where  assets are located to be informed of the opening of the succession. In the context of the application of this Regulation, consideration  should  therefore  be  given  to  the  possibility of establishing a mechanism, if appropriate by way of the e-Justice portal, to enable potential creditors in other Member  States  to access the relevant  information so that  they  can  make  their  claims  known.
- (47) The  law  applicable  to  the  succession  should  determine who  the  beneficiaries  are  in  any  given  succession.  Under most  laws,  the  term  'beneficiaries'  would  cover  heirs  and legatees and persons entitled to a reserved share although,  for  instance,  the  legal  position  of  legatees  is not the same  under  all laws. Under  some  laws,  the legatee  may  receive  a  direct  share  in  the  estate  whereas under  other  laws  the  legatee  may  acquire  only  a  claim against  the  heirs.
- (48) In  order  to  ensure  legal  certainty  for  persons  wishing  to plan  their  succession  in  advance,  this  Regulation  should lay  down  a  specific  conflict-of-laws  rule  concerning  the admissibility  and  substantive  validity  of  dispositions  of property  upon  death.  To  ensure  the  uniform  application of  that  rule,  this  Regulation  should  list  which  elements should be considered as elements pertaining to substantive  validity.  The  examination  of  the  substantive validity of  a  disposition of  property upon  death  may lead to  the  conclusion  that  that  disposition  is  without  legal existence.
- (49) An agreement as to succession is a type of  disposition of property  upon  death  the  admissibility  and  acceptance  of which  vary  among  the  Member  States.  In  order  to  make it  easier  for  succession  rights  acquired  as  a  result  of  an agreement as to succession to be accepted in the Member States,  this  Regulation  should  determine  which  law  is  to govern the admissibility of such agreements, their substantive validity  and their binding effects  between the  parties,  including  the  conditions  for  their  dissolution.
- (50) The  law  which,  under  this  Regulation,  will  govern  the admissibility  and  substantive  validity  of  a  disposition  of property  upon  death  and,  as  regards  agreements  as  to succession,  the  binding  effects  of  such  an  agreement  as between  the  parties,  should  be  without  prejudice  to  the rights of any person who, under the law applicable to the succession,  has  a  right  to  a  reserved  share  or  another right  of  which  he  cannot  be  deprived  by  the  person whose  estate  is  involved.
- (51) Where  reference  is  made  in  this  Regulation  to  the  law which  would  have  been  applicable  to  the  succession  of the  person  making  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death if  he  had  died  on  the  day  on  which  the  disposition  was, as  the  case  may  be,  made,  modified  or  revoked,  such reference  should  be  understood  as  a  reference  to  either the  law  of  the  State  of  the  habitual  residence  of  the person  concerned  on  that  day  or,  if  he  had  made  a choice of law under  this Regulation, the law of the State  of  his  nationality  on  that  day.
- (52) This Regulation should regulate the validity as to  form of all  dispositions  of  property  upon  death  made  in  writing by  way  of  rules  which  are  consistent  with  those  of  the Hague  Convention  of  5  October  1961  on  the  Conflicts of  Laws  Relating  to  the  Form  of  Testamentary  Disposi­ tions.  When  determining  whether  a  given  disposition  of property  upon  death  is  formally  valid  under  this  Regu­ lation, the competent authority should disregard the fraudulent creation of an international element to circumvent  the  rules  on  formal  validity.

- (53) For  the  purposes of  this  Regulation, any  provision  of  law limiting  the  permitted  forms  of  dispositions  of  property upon death by reference to certain personal qualifications of the person making the disposition, such as, for instance, his age, should be deemed to pertain to matters of form. This should not be interpreted as meaning  that  the  law  applicable  to  the  formal  validity of  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death  under  this  Regu­ lation  should  determine  whether  or  not  a  minor  has  the capacity  to  make  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death. That law should only determine whether a personal qualification  such  as,  for  instance,  minority  should  bar a  person  from  making  a  disposition  of  property  upon death  in  a  certain  form.
- (54) For  economic,  family  or social considerations,  certain immovable property, certain enterprises and other special  categories  of  assets  are  subject  to  special  rules in the Member State in which they are located imposing restrictions concerning or affecting the succession  in respect of those assets.  This  Regulation should ensure the application of such special rules. However,  this  exception  to  the  application  of  the  law applicable  to the  succession  requires  a strict  interpre­ tation  in  order  to  remain  compatible  with  the  general objective  of  this  Regulation.  Therefore,  neither  conflictof-laws  rules  subjecting  immovable  property  to  a  law different  from  that  applicable  to  movable  property  nor provisions  providing  for  a  reserved  share  of  the  estate greater than that provided for in the law applicable to the succession  under  this  Regulation  may  be  regarded  as constituting special rules imposing restrictions concerning or affecting the succession in respect of certain  assets.
- (55) To  ensure  uniform  handling  of  a  situation  in  which  it  is uncertain  in  what  order  two  or  more  persons  whose succession  would  be  governed  by  different  laws  died, this  Regulation  should  lay  down  a  rule  providing  that none  of  the  deceased  persons  is  to  have  any  rights  in the  succession  of  the  other  or  others.
- (56) In some  situations an estate may  be left without a claimant.  Different  laws  provide  differently  for  such  situ­ ations.  Under  some  laws,  the  State  will  be  able  to  claim the  vacant  estate  as  an  heir  irrespective  of  where  the assets are located. Under  some  other  laws,  the State will  be  able  to  appropriate  only  the  assets  located  on its  territory.  This  Regulation  should  therefore  lay  down a  rule providing that the application of the law applicable to  the  succession  should  not  preclude  a  Member  State from  appropriating  under  its  own  law  the  assets  located on  its  territory.  However,  to  ensure  that  this  rule  is  not detrimental to the creditors of the estate, a proviso should  be  added  enabling  the  creditors  to seek satis­ faction of their claims out of all the assets of the estate,  irrespective  of  their  location.
- (57) The  conflict-of-laws  rules  laid  down  in  this  Regulation may lead to the application of the law of a third State. In such  cases  regard  should  be  had  to  the  private  inter­ national  law  rules  of  that  State.  If  those  rules  provide for renvoi either  to  the  law  of  a  Member  State  or  to the  law  of  a  third  State  which  would  apply  its  own law  to  the  succession,  such renvoi should  be  accepted in order to ensure international consistency. Renvoi should,  however,  be  excluded  in  situations  where  the deceased  had  made  a  choice  of  law  in  favour  of  the law  of  a  third  State.
- (58) Considerations  of  public  interest  should  allow  courts  and other competent authorities dealing with matters of succession  in  the  Member  States  to  disregard,  in  excep­ tional  circumstances,  certain  provisions  of  a  foreign  law where,  in  a  given  case,  applying  such  provisions  would be  manifestly  incompatible  with  the  public  policy  ( ordre public )  of  the  Member  State  concerned.  However,  the courts or other competent  authorities should not be able  to  apply  the  public-policy  exception  in  order  to set aside the law of another State or to refuse to recognise  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  accept  or  enforce  a decision,  an  authentic  instrument  or  a  court  settlement from  another  Member  State  when  doing  so  would  be contrary  to  the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the European  Union,  and  in  particular  Article  21  thereof, which  prohibits  all  forms  of  discrimination.
- (59) In  the  light  of  its  general  objective,  which  is  the  mutual recognition  of  decisions  given  in  the  Member  States  in matters of succession, irrespective of whether such decisions  were  given  in  contentious  or  non-contentious proceedings, this Regulation should lay down rules relating to the recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions similar to those of other Union  instruments  in  the  area  of  judicial  cooperation in  civil  matters.
- (60) In  order  to  take  into  account  the  different  systems  for dealing  with  matters  of  succession  in  the  Member  States, this Regulation should guarantee the acceptance and enforceability in all Member States of authentic instruments  in  matters  of  succession.
- (61) Authentic  instruments  should  have  the  same  evidentiary effects in another  Member  State  as  they  have  in  the Member State of origin, or the most comparable effects.  When  determining  the  evidentiary  effects  of  a given  authentic  instrument  in  another  Member  State  or the most comparable effects, reference should be made to the  nature  and  the  scope  of  the  evidentiary  effects  of  the authentic  instrument  in  the  Member  State  of  origin.  The evidentiary  effects  which  a  given  authentic  instrument should have in another Member  State will therefore depend  on  the  law  of  the  Member  State  of  origin.

- (62) The  'authenticity'  of  an  authentic  instrument  should  be an  autonomous  concept  covering  elements  such  as  the genuineness  of  the  instrument,  the  formal  prerequisites of  the  instrument,  the  powers  of  the  authority  drawing up  the  instrument  and  the  procedure  under  which  the instrument  is  drawn  up.  It  should  also  cover  the  factual elements  recorded  in  the  authentic  instrument  by  the authority  concerned,  such  as  the  fact  that  the  parties indicated appeared  before that authority  on the date indicated  and  that  they  made  the  declarations  indicated. A party wishing to challenge the authenticity of an authentic instrument should do so before the competent  court  in  the  Member  State  of  origin  of  the authentic instrument under the law of that Member State.
- (63) The  term  'the  legal  acts  or  legal  relationships  recorded  in an authentic instrument' should be interpreted as referring to the  contents  as  to  substance  recorded  in the  authentic  instrument.  The  legal  acts  recorded  in  an authentic instrument could be, for instance, the agreement  between  the  parties  on the  sharing-out or the  distribution  of  the  estate,  or  a  will  or  an  agreement as  to  succession,  or  another  declaration  of  intent.  The legal relationships could be, for instance, the deter­ mination  of  the  heirs  and  other  beneficiaries  as  estab­ lished  under  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession,  their respective shares and  the existence of  a reserved share, or any other element established under the law applicable to the  succession.  A  party  wishing  to  challenge  the  legal acts or legal relationships recorded in an authentic instrument  should  do  so  before  the  courts  having  juris­ diction  under  this  Regulation,  which  should  decide  on the  challenge  in  accordance  with  the  law  applicable  to the  succession.
- (64) If a question relating to the legal acts or legal rela­ tionships  recorded  in  an  authentic  instrument  is  raised as  an  incidental question in proceedings before a court of a  Member  State,  that  court  should  have  jurisdiction  over that  question.
- (65) An authentic instrument which is being challenged should not produce any evidentiary effects in a Member  State  other  than  the  Member  State  of  origin  as long as the challenge is pending. If the challenge concerns only a specific matter relating to the legal acts or legal relationships recorded in the authentic instrument,  the  authentic  instrument  in  question  should not  produce  any  evidentiary  effects  in  a  Member  State other  than  the  Member  State  of  origin  with  regard  to  the matter being challenged as long as the challenge is pending. An authentic instrument which has been declared  invalid  as  a  result  of  a  challenge  should  cease to  produce  any  evidentiary  effects.
- (66) Should an authority, in the application of this Regulation, be presented with two  incompatible  authentic  instru­ ments, it should assess the question as to which authentic  instrument,  if  any,  should  be  given  priority, taking  into  account  the  circumstances  of  the  particular case.  Where  it  is  not  clear  from  those  circumstances

which authentic instrument, if any, should be given priority, the question should be determined by the courts having jurisdiction under this Regulation, or, where  the  question  is  raised  as  an  incidental  question in the course  of proceedings,  by the court seised of those proceedings. In the event of incompatibility between  an  authentic  instrument  and  a  decision,  regard should  be had  to  the  grounds  of  non-recognition  of decisions  under  this  Regulation.

- (67) In  order  for  a  succession  with  cross-border  implications within  the  Union  to  be  settled  speedily,  smoothly  and efficiently,  the  heirs,  legatees,  executors  of  the  will  or administrators  of  the  estate  should  be  able  to  demon­ strate easily their status and/or  rights  and  powers  in another  Member  State,  for  instance  in  a  Member  State in  which  succession  property  is  located.  To  enable  them to  do  so,  this  Regulation  should  provide  for  the  creation of a uniform certificate, the European Certificate of Succession  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  'the  Certificate'),  to be  issued  for  use  in  another  Member  State.  In  order  to respect the principle of subsidiarity, the Certificate should not take the place of internal documents which may exist for  similar  purposes  in  the  Member  States.
- (68) The  authority  which  issues  the  Certificate  should  have regard  to  the  formalities  required  for  the  registration  of immovable  property  in  the  Member  State  in  which  the register  is  kept.  For  that  purpose,  this  Regulation  should provide for an exchange of information on such formalities  between  the  Member  States.
- (69) The  use  of  the  Certificate  should  not  be  mandatory.  This means  that  persons  entitled  to  apply  for  a  Certificate should  be  under  no  obligation  to  do  so  but  should  be free  to  use  the  other  instruments  available  under  this Regulation  (decisions,  authentic  instruments  and  court settlements).  However,  no  authority  or  person  presented with  a  Certificate  issued  in  another  Member  State  should be entitled to request that a decision, authentic instrument  or  court  settlement  be  presented  instead  of the  Certificate.
- (70) The  Certificate  should  be  issued  in  the  Member  State whose  courts  have  jurisdiction  under  this  Regulation.  It should  be  for  each  Member  State  to  determine  in  its internal legislation which authorities are to have competence  to issue the Certificate,  whether  they be courts  as  defined  for  the  purposes  of  this  Regulation  or other authorities with competence in matters of succession,  such  as,  for  instance,  notaries.  It  should  also be  for  each  Member  State  to  determine  in  its  internal legislation whether  the issuing authority  may  involve other competent bodies in the issuing process, for instance  bodies  competent  to  receive  statutory  declar­ ations  in  lieu  of  an  oath.  The  Member  States  should

communicate to the Commission the relevant information concerning their issuing authorities in order  for  that  information  to  be  made  publicly  available.

- (71) The  Certificate  should  produce  the  same  effects  in  all Member  States.  It  should  not  be  an  enforceable  title  in its  own  right  but  should  have  an  evidentiary  effect  and should  be  presumed  to  demonstrate  accurately  elements which  have  been  established  under  the  law  applicable  to the succession or  under  any other law applicable to specific elements, such as the substantive validity of dispositions of property upon  death. The evidentiary effect  of  the  Certificate  should  not  extend  to  elements which  are not governed by this Regulation, such as questions  of  affiliation  or  the  question  whether  or  not a  particular  asset  belonged  to  the  deceased.  Any  person who  makes  payments  or  passes  on  succession  property to  a  person  indicated  in  the  Certificate  as  being  entitled to  accept  such  payment  or  property  as  an  heir  or  legatee should  be  afforded  appropriate  protection  if  he  acted  in good  faith  relying  on  the  accuracy  of  the  information certified  in  the  Certificate.  The  same  protection  should be  afforded  to  any  person  who,  relying  on  the  accuracy of  the  information  certified  in  the  Certificate,  buys  or receives  succession  property  from  a  person  indicated  in the Certificate as being entitled to dispose of such property.  The  protection  should  be  ensured  if  certified copies  which  are  still  valid  are  presented.  Whether  or not  such  an  acquisition  of  property  by  a  third  person is  effective  should  not  be  determined  by  this  Regulation.
- (72) The competent authority should issue the Certificate upon request. The original of the Certificate should remain  with  the  issuing  authority,  which  should  issue one  or  more  certified  copies  of  the  Certificate  to  the applicant and to any other person demonstrating a legitimate  interest.  This  should  not  preclude  a  Member State,  in  accordance  with  its  national  rules  on  public access to documents, from allowing copies of the Certificate to be disclosed  to  members  of  the  public. This Regulation should provide for redress against decisions of the issuing authority,  including decisions to  refuse  the  issue  of  a  Certificate.  Where  the  Certificate is  rectified,  modified  or  withdrawn,  the  issuing  authority should inform the persons to whom certified copies have been  issued  so  as  to  avoid  wrongful  use  of  such  copies.
- (73) Respect  for  international  commitments  entered  into  by the Member States means that this Regulation should not affect the application of international conventions to which  one  or more  Member  States  are  party  at the time  when  this  Regulation  is  adopted.  In  particular,  the Member  States which are Contracting Parties to the Hague  Convention  of  5  October  1961  on  the  Conflicts of Laws Relating to the Form of Testamentary Dispositions  should  be  able  to  continue  to  apply  the provisions  of  that  Convention  instead  of  the  provisions of  this  Regulation  with  regard  to  the  formal  validity  of wills and joint wills. Consistency with the general objectives  of  this  Regulation  requires,  however,  that  this Regulation  take  precedence,  as  between  Member  States,

over  conventions  concluded  exclusively  between  two  or more Member  States in so far as such conventions concern  matters  governed  by  this  Regulation.

- (74) This Regulation should not preclude  Member States which  are  parties  to  the  Convention  of  19  November 1934  between  Denmark,  Finland,  Iceland,  Norway  and Sweden  comprising  private  international  law  provisions on succession, wills and estate administration from continuing to apply certain provisions of that Convention, as revised by the intergovernmental agreement  between  the  States  parties  thereto.
- (75) In  order  to  facilitate  the  application  of  this  Regulation, provision should be  made  for  an  obligation  requiring the Member States to communicate certain information regarding their legislation and procedures relating to succession within the framework of the European Judicial  Network  in  civil  and  commercial  matters  estab­ lished  by  Council  Decision  2001/470/EC (  1  ).  In  order  to allow  for  the  timely  publication  in  the Official  Journal  of the  European  Union of  all  information  of  relevance  for  the practical application of this Regulation, the  Member States should also communicate  such  information to the  Commission  before  this  Regulation  starts  to  apply.
- (76) Equally,  to  facilitate  the  application  of  this  Regulation and to allow for the use of modern communication tech­ nologies,  standard  forms  should  be  prescribed  for  the attestations  to  be  provided  in  connection  with  the  appli­ cation  for  a  declaration  of  enforceability  of  a  decision, authentic  instrument  or court settlement and  for the application  for  a  European  Certificate  of  Succession,  as well  as  for  the  Certificate  itself.
- (77) In  calculating  the  periods  and  time  limits  provided  for  in this  Regulation,  Regulation  (EEC,  Euratom)  No 1182/71 of  the  Council  of  3  June  1971  determining  the  rules applicable  to periods,  dates  and  time  limits (  2  )  should apply.
- (78) In  order  to  ensure  uniform  conditions  for  the  implemen­ tation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred  on  the  Commission  with  regard  to  the  estab­ lishment  and  subsequent  amendment  of  the  attestations and  forms  pertaining  to  the  declaration  of  enforceability of  decisions,  court  settlements  and  authentic  instruments and  to the European  Certificate  of Succession.  Those powers  should  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  Regu­ lation  (EU)  No 182/2011  of  the  European  Parliament and  of  the  Council  of  16  February  2011  laying  down the  rules  and  general  principles  concerning  mechanisms

for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise  of  implementing  powers (  1  ).

- (79) The  advisory  procedure  should  be  used  for  the  adoption of implementing acts establishing and subsequently amending  the  attestations  and forms  provided  for in this  Regulation  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  laid down  in  Article  4  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 182/2011.
- (80) Since  the  objectives  of  this  Regulation,  namely  the  free movement  of  persons,  the  organisation  in  advance  by citizens  of  their  succession  in  a  Union  context  and  the protection  of the rights of heirs  and  legatees  and of persons close to the deceased, as well as of the creditors of the succession, cannot be sufficiently achieved  by  the  Member  States  and  can  therefore,  by reason  of  the  scale  and  effects  of  this  Regulation,  be better  achieved  at  Union  level,  the  Union  may  adopt measures  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of  subsidiarity as  set  out  in  Article  5  of  the  Treaty  on  European  Union. In  accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out  in  that  Article,  this  Regulation  does  not  go  beyond what  is  necessary  in  order  to  achieve  those  objectives.
- (81) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European  Union.  This  Regu­ lation must be applied by the courts and other competent authorities of the Member States in observance  of  those  rights  and  principles.
- (82) In  accordance  with  Articles  1  and  2  of  Protocol  No 21 on  the  position  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  Ireland  in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed  to  the  Treaty  on  European  Union  and  to  the Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union,  those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation  and  are  not  bound  by  it  or  subject  to  its application.  This  is,  however,  without  prejudice  to  the possibility for the United Kingdom and Ireland of notifying their intention of accepting this Regulation after  its  adoption  in  accordance  with  Article  4  of  the said  Protocol.
- (83) In  accordance  with  Articles  1  and  2  of  Protocol  No 22 on  the  position  of  Denmark,  annexed  to  the  Treaty  on European Union  and  to  the  Treaty on  the  Functioning  of the  European  Union,  Denmark  is  not  taking  part  in  the adoption  of  this  Regulation  and  is  not  bound  by  it  or subject  to  its  application,

HAVE  ADOPTED  THIS  REGULATION:

## JURISDICTION

## Article  4

## General  jurisdiction

The  courts  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  deceased  had  his habitual  residence  at  the  time  of  death  shall  have  jurisdiction  to rule  on  the  succession  as  a  whole.

## Article  5

## Choice-of-court  agreement

1. Where  the  law  chosen  by  the  deceased  to  govern  his succession  pursuant  to  Article  22  is  the  law  of  a  Member State,  the  parties  concerned  may  agree  that  a  court  or  the courts  of  that  Member  State  are  to  have  exclusive  jurisdiction to  rule  on  any  succession  matter.
2. Such  a  choice-of-court  agreement  shall  be  expressed  in writing, dated and signed by the parties concerned. Any communication  by  electronic  means  which  provides  a  durable record  of  the  agreement  shall  be  deemed  equivalent  to  writing.

## Article  6

## Declining  of  jurisdiction  in  the  event  of  a  choice  of  law

Where the law chosen by the deceased to govern his succession pursuant  to  Article  22  is  the  law  of  a  Member  State,  the  court seised  pursuant  to  Article  4  or  Article  10:

- (a) may, at the  request of  one  of  the  parties  to  the  proceedings, decline  jurisdiction  if  it  considers  that  the  courts  of  the Member  State  of  the  chosen  law  are  better  placed  to  rule on  the  succession,  taking  into  account  the  practical  circum­ stances  of  the  succession,  such  as  the  habitual  residence  of the  parties  and  the  location  of  the  assets;  or
- (b)  shall  decline  jurisdiction  if  the  parties  to  the  proceedings have  agreed,  in  accordance  with  Article  5,  to  confer  juris­ diction  on  a  court  or  the  courts  of  the  Member  State  of  the chosen  law.

## Article  7

## Jurisdiction  in  the  event  of  a  choice  of  law

The  courts  of  a  Member  State  whose  law  had  been  chosen  by the  deceased  pursuant  to  Article  22  shall  have  jurisdiction  to rule  on  the  succession  if:

- (a) a  court  previously  seised  has  declined  jurisdiction  in  the same  case  pursuant  to  Article  6;
- (b)  the  parties  to  the  proceedings  have  agreed,  in  accordance with  Article  5, to confer  jurisdiction  on  a  court  or  the courts  of  that  Member  State;  or
- (c) the  parties  to  the  proceedings  have  expressly  accepted  the jurisdiction  of  the  court  seised.

## Article  8

## Closing of own-motion  proceedings  in  the  event  of a choice  of  law

A  court  which  has  opened  succession  proceedings  of  its  own motion under Article 4 or Article 10 shall close the proceedings if the parties to the proceedings  have  agreed to settle the succession  amicably  out  of  court  in  the  Member  State  whose law  had  been  chosen  by  the  deceased  pursuant  to  Article  22.

## Article  9

## Jurisdiction  based  on  appearance

1. Where,  in  the  course  of  proceedings  before  a  court  of  a Member  State  exercising  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  Article  7,  it appears  that  not  all  the  parties  to  those  proceedings  were  party to  the  choice-of-court  agreement,  the  court  shall  continue  to exercise  jurisdiction  if  the  parties  to  the  proceedings  who  were not party to the agreement enter an appearance without contesting  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court.
2. If  the  jurisdiction of  the court referred to in paragraph 1 is contested  by  parties  to  the  proceedings  who  were  not  party  to the  agreement,  the  court  shall  decline  jurisdiction.

In  that  event, jurisdiction to  rule on  the succession shall lie with the courts having jurisdiction pursuant to Article 4 or Article  10.

## Article  10

## Subsidiary  jurisdiction

1. Where  the  habitual  residence  of  the  deceased  at  the  time of  death  is  not  located  in  a  Member  State,  the  courts  of  a Member  State  in  which  assets  of  the  estate  are  located  shall nevertheless  have  jurisdiction  to  rule  on  the  succession  as  a whole  in  so  far  as:
2. (a)  the deceased had the nationality of that Member State at the time  of  death;  or,  failing  that,

- (b)  the  deceased  had  his  previous  habitual  residence  in  that Member  State, provided that, at the time the court is seised,  a  period  of  not  more  than  five  years  has  elapsed since  that  habitual  residence  changed.
2. Where no court in a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant  to  paragraph  1,  the  courts  of  the  Member  State  in which  assets  of  the  estate  are  located  shall  nevertheless  have jurisdiction  to  rule  on  those  assets.

## Article  11

## Forum  necessitatis

Where no  court  of  a  Member  State  has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to other  provisions  of  this  Regulation,  the  courts  of  a  Member State  may,  on  an  exceptional  basis,  rule  on  the  succession  if proceedings  cannot  reasonably  be  brought  or  conducted  or would  be  impossible  in  a  third  State  with  which  the  case  is closely  connected.

The  case  must  have  a  sufficient  connection  with  the  Member State  of  the  court  seised.

## Article  12

## Limitation  of  proceedings

1. Where  the  estate  of  the  deceased  comprises  assets  located in  a  third  State,  the  court  seised  to  rule  on  the  succession  may, at  the  request of  one  of  the parties, decide not  to rule on  one or more  of  such  assets  if  it  may  be  expected  that  its  decision  in respect  of  those  assets  will  not  be  recognised  and,  where  appli­ cable,  declared  enforceable  in  that  third  State.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the right of the parties to limit the scope of the proceedings under the law of the Member State of  the  court  seised.

## Article  13

## Acceptance or waiver of the succession, of a legacy or of a reserved  share

In addition to the court  having  jurisdiction  to rule  on  the succession pursuant to this Regulation, the courts of the Member  State  of  the  habitual  residence  of  any  person  who, under  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession,  may  make,  before a  court,  a  declaration  concerning  the  acceptance  or  waiver  of the succession, of a legacy or of a reserved share, or a declaration designed to limit the liability of the person concerned  in  respect  of the liabilities  under  the succession, shall have jurisdiction to receive such declarations where, under  the  law  of  that  Member  State,  such  declarations  may be  made  before  a  court.

## Article  14

## Seising  of  a  court

For  the  purposes  of  this  Chapter,  a  court  shall  be  deemed  to  be seised:

- (a) at  the  time  when  the  document  instituting  the  proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided  that  the  applicant  has  not  subsequently  failed  to take the steps he was  required  to take to have  service effected  on  the  defendant;
- (b)  if  the  document  has  to  be  served  before  being  lodged  with the  court,  at  the  time  when  it  is  received  by  the  authority responsible  for  service,  provided  that  the  applicant  has  not subsequently failed to  take  the  steps he  was  required to  take to  have  the  document  lodged  with  the  court;  or
- (c) if  the  proceedings  are  opened  of  the  court's  own  motion,  at the time when the decision to open the proceedings is taken by  the  court,  or,  where  such  a  decision  is  not  required,  at the  time  when  the  case  is  registered  by  the  court.

## Article  15

## Examination  as  to  jurisdiction

Where  a  court  of  a  Member  State  is  seised  of  a  succession matter  over  which  it  has  no  jurisdiction  under  this  Regulation, it  shall  declare  of  its  own  motion  that  it  has  no  jurisdiction.

## Article  16

## Examination  as  to  admissibility

1. Where  a  defendant  habitually  resident  in  a  State  other than  the  Member  State  where  the  action  was  brought  does not  enter an  appearance,  the  court  having  jurisdiction  shall stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown  that the defendant  has  been  able  to  receive  the  document  instituting the  proceedings  or  an  equivalent  document  in  time  to  arrange for  his  defence,  or  that  all  necessary  steps  have  been  taken  to that  end.
2. Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of  13  November 2007  on  the  service  in  the  Member  States  of  judicial  and  extra­ judicial  documents  in  civil  or  commercial  matters  (service  of documents) (  1 ) shall apply instead of paragraph 1 of this Article if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent  document  had  to  be  transmitted  from  one  Member State  to  another  pursuant  to  that  Regulation.

3. Where  Regulation  (EC)  No 1393/2007  is  not  applicable, Article  15  of  the  Hague  Convention  of  15  November  1965  on the  Service  Abroad  of  Judicial  and  Extrajudicial  Documents  in Civil  or  Commercial  Matters  shall  apply  if  the  document  insti­ tuting  the  proceedings  or  an  equivalent  document  had  to  be transmitted  abroad  pursuant  to  that  Convention.

## Article  17

## Lis  pendens

1. Where  proceedings  involving  the  same  cause  of  action and  between  the  same  parties  are  brought  in  the  courts  of different  Member  States,  any  court  other  than  the  court  first seised  shall  of  its  own  motion  stay  its  proceedings  until  such time  as  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court  first  seised  is  established.
2. Where  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court  first  seised  is  estab­ lished,  any  court  other  than  the  court  first  seised  shall  decline jurisdiction  in  favour  of  that  court.

## Article  18

## Related  actions

1. Where related actions are pending in the courts of different  Member  States,  any  court  other  than  the  court  first seised  may  stay  its  proceedings.
2. Where  those  actions  are  pending  at  first  instance,  any court  other  than  the  court  first  seised  may  also,  on  the  appli­ cation  of  one  of  the  parties,  decline  jurisdiction if  the  court  first seised  has  jurisdiction  over  the  actions  in  question  and  its  law permits  the  consolidation  thereof.
3. For  the  purposes  of  this  Article,  actions  are  deemed  to  be related  where  they  are  so  closely  connected  that  it  is  expedient to  hear  and  determine  them  together  to  avoid  the  risk  of  irrec­ oncilable  decisions  resulting  from  separate  proceedings.

## Article  19

## Provisional,  including  protective,  measures

Application  may  be  made  to  the  courts  of  a  Member  State  for such provisional, including protective,  measures as may  be available  under  the  law  of  that  State,  even  if,  under  this  Regu­ lation,  the  courts  of  another  Member  State  have  jurisdiction  as to  the  substance  of  the  matter.

## CHAPTER  III

2. Where,  by way  of exception, it is clear from  all the circumstances of the case that, at the time of death, the deceased  was  manifestly  more  closely  connected  with  a  State other  than  the  State  whose  law  would  be  applicable  under paragraph  1,  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession  shall  be  the law  of  that  other  State.

## Article  22

## Choice  of  law

1. A  person  may  choose  as  the  law  to  govern  his  succession as  a  whole  the  law  of  the  State  whose  nationality  he  possesses at  the  time  of  making  the  choice  or  at  the  time  of  death.

A  person  possessing  multiple  nationalities  may  choose  the  law of  any  of  the  States  whose  nationality  he  possesses  at  the  time of  making  the  choice  or  at  the  time  of  death.

2. The  choice  shall  be  made  expressly  in  a  declaration  in  the form  of a disposition of property  upon  death  or shall be demonstrated  by  the  terms  of  such  a  disposition.
3. The  substantive  validity  of  the  act  whereby  the  choice  of law  was  made  shall  be  governed  by  the  chosen  law.
4. Any  modification  or  revocation  of  the  choice  of  law  shall meet  the  requirements  as  to  form  for  the  modification  or  revo­ cation  of  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death.

3. (b)  the  determination  of  the  beneficiaries,  of  their  respective shares  and  of  the  obligations  which  may  be  imposed  on them  by the deceased, and the determination of other succession rights, including the succession rights of the surviving  spouse  or  partner;
4. (c) the  capacity  to  inherit;

7. (f) the  powers  of  the  heirs,  the  executors of  the  wills  and  other administrators  of  the  estate,  in  particular  as  regards  the  sale of  property  and  the  payment  of  creditors,  without  prejudice to  the  powers  referred  to  in  Article  29(2)  and  (3);

## Article  24

## Dispositions of property upon death other than agreements  as  to  succession

1. A disposition of property upon  death other than an agreement  as  to  succession  shall  be  governed,  as  regards  its admissibility  and  substantive  validity,  by  the  law  which,  under this  Regulation, would have been applicable to the succession of the  person  who  made  the  disposition  if  he  had  died  on  the  day on  which  the  disposition  was  made.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a person may choose as the law to govern his disposition of property upon death, as regards its  admissibility  and  substantive  validity,  the  law  which  that

person  could  have  chosen  in  accordance  with  Article  22  on the  conditions  set  out  therein.

3. Paragraph  1  shall  apply,  as  appropriate,  to  the  modifi­ cation  or  revocation  of  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death other  than  an  agreement  as  to  succession.  In  the  event  of  a choice  of  law  in  accordance  with  paragraph  2,  the  modification or  revocation  shall  be  governed  by  the  chosen  law.

## Article  25

## Agreements  as  to  succession

1. An agreement as to succession regarding the succession of one  person  shall  be  governed,  as  regards  its  admissibility,  its substantive  validity  and  its  binding  effects  between  the  parties, including  the  conditions  for  its  dissolution,  by  the  law  which, under this Regulation, would have been applicable to the succession  of  that  person  if  he  had  died  on  the  day  on  which the  agreement  was  concluded.
2. An agreement as to succession regarding the succession of several  persons  shall  be  admissible  only  if  it  is  admissible  under all  the  laws  which,  under  this  Regulation,  would  have  governed the  succession  of  all  the  persons  involved  if  they  had  died  on the  day  on  which  the  agreement  was  concluded.

An  agreement  as  to  succession  which  is  admissible  pursuant  to the first subparagraph shall be governed, as regards its substantive  validity  and  its  binding  effects  between  the  parties, including  the  conditions  for  its  dissolution,  by  the  law,  from among those referred to in the first subparagraph, with which it has  the  closest  connection.

3. Notwithstanding  paragraphs  1  and  2,  the  parties  may choose  as  the  law  to  govern  their  agreement  as  to  succession, as regards its admissibility, its substantive validity and its binding  effects  between  the  parties,  including  the  conditions for  its  dissolution,  the  law  which  the  person  or  one  of  the persons whose estate is involved could have chosen in accordance  with  Article  22  on  the  conditions  set  out  therein.

## Article  26

## Substantive validity of dispositions of property upon death

1. For  the  purposes  of  Articles  24  and  25  the  following elements  shall  pertain  to  substantive  validity:
2. (a) the capacity of the person making the disposition of property  upon  death  to  make  such  a  disposition;

- (b)  the particular causes which  bar the  person  making  the disposition  from  disposing  in  favour  of  certain  persons  or which bar a person from receiving succession property from the  person  making  the  disposition;
- (c) the admissibility of representation for the purposes of making  a  disposition  of  property  upon  death;
- (d)  the  interpretation  of  the  disposition;
- (e) fraud,  duress,  mistake  and  any  other  questions  relating  to the consent or intention of the person making the disposition.
2. Where a person has  the  capacity to  make  a  disposition  of property  upon  death  under the law applicable pursuant  to Article  24 or Article 25, a subsequent change  of the law applicable  shall  not affect  his  capacity  to  modify  or  revoke such  a  disposition.

## Article  27

## Formal  validity  of  dispositions  of  property  upon  death made  in  writing

1. A  disposition  of  property  upon  death  made  in  writing shall  be  valid  as  regards  form  if  its  form  complies  with  the  law:
2. (a) of the  State  in  which  the  disposition  was  made  or  the agreement  as  to  succession  concluded;
3. (b)  of  a  State  whose  nationality  the  testator  or  at  least  one  of the  persons whose succession is concerned by an agreement as  to  succession  possessed,  either  at  the  time  when  the disposition  was  made  or  the  agreement  concluded,  or  at the  time  of  death;
4. (c) of a State in which  the  testator  or  at least one  of  the persons  whose  succession  is  concerned  by  an  agreement as  to  succession  had  his  domicile,  either  at  the  time  when the  disposition  was  made  or  the  agreement  concluded, or  at the  time  of  death;
5. (d)  of  the  State  in  which  the  testator  or  at  least  one  of  the persons  whose  succession  is  concerned  by  an  agreement as  to  succession  had  his  habitual  residence,  either  at  the time when  the  disposition  was  made  or  the  agreement concluded,  or  at  the  time  of  death;  or
6. (e) in  so  far  as  immovable  property  is  concerned,  of  the  State in  which  that  property  is  located.

The  determination  of  the  question  whether  or  not  the  testator or  any  person  whose  succession  is  concerned  by  the  agreement as  to  succession  had  his  domicile  in  a  particular  State  shall  be governed  by  the  law  of  that  State.

2. Paragraph  1  shall  also  apply  to  dispositions  of  property upon  death  modifying  or  revoking  an  earlier  disposition.  The modification  or  revocation  shall  also  be  valid  as  regards  form  if it  complies  with  any  one  of  the  laws  according  to  the  terms  of which,  under  paragraph  1,  the  disposition  of  property  upon death  which  has  been  modified  or  revoked  was  valid.
3. For  the  purposes  of  this  Article,  any  provision  of  law which  limits  the  permitted  forms  of  dispositions  of  property upon death by reference to the age, nationality or other personal  conditions  of  the  testator  or  of  the  persons  whose succession is concerned by an agreement as to succession shall  be  deemed  to  pertain  to  matters  of  form.  The  same  rule shall apply to the qualifications to be possessed by any witnesses  required  for  the  validity  of  a  disposition  of  property upon  death.

## Article  28

## Validity  as  to  form  of  a  declaration  concerning  acceptance or  waiver

- A declaration concerning the acceptance or waiver of the succession,  of  a  legacy  or  of  a  reserved  share,  or  a  declaration designed  to  limit  the  liability  of  the  person  making  the  declar­ ation,  shall  be  valid  as  to  form  where  it  meets  the  requirements of:
- (a) the  law  applicable  to  the  succession  pursuant  to  Article  21 or  Article  22;  or
- (b)  the law of the State in which  the person making  the declaration  has  his  habitual  residence.

## Article  29

## Special rules on the appointment and powers of an administrator  of  the  estate  in  certain  situations

1. Where  the  appointment  of  an  administrator  is  mandatory or  mandatory  upon  request  under  the  law  of  the  Member  State whose courts have jurisdiction to rule on the succession pursuant to this Regulation and the law applicable to the succession  is  a  foreign  law,  the  courts  of  that  Member  State may,  when  seised,  appoint  one  or  more  administrators  of  the estate  under  their  own  law,  subject  to  the  conditions  laid  down in  this  Article.

The  administrator(s)  appointed  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall be  the  person(s)  entitled  to  execute  the  will  of  the  deceased and/or  to  administer  the  estate  under  the  law  applicable  to the  succession. Where  that  law  does  not  provide for  the  admin­ istration  of  the  estate  by  a  person  who  is  not  a  beneficiary,  the courts  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  administrator  is  to  be appointed  may  appoint  a  third-party  administrator  under  their own law if that law so requires and there is a serious conflict of interests  between  the  beneficiaries  or  between  the  beneficiaries and  the  creditors  or  other  persons  having  guaranteed  the  debts of  the  deceased,  a  disagreement  amongst  the  beneficiaries  on the administration of the estate or a complex estate to administer  due  to  the  nature  of  the  assets.

The  administrator(s)  appointed  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall be  the  only  person(s)  entitled  to  exercise  the  powers  referred  to in  paragraph  2  or  3.

2. The  person(s)  appointed  as  administrator(s)  pursuant  to paragraph  1  shall  exercise  the  powers  to  administer  the  estate which  he  or  they  may  exercise  under  the  law  applicable  to  the succession.  The  appointing  court  may,  in  its  decision,  lay  down specific conditions for the exercise of such powers in accordance  with  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession.

Where the law applicable to the succession does not provide for sufficient  powers  to  preserve  the  assets  of the estate or to protect  the  rights  of  the  creditors  or  of  other  persons  having guaranteed  the  debts  of  the  deceased,  the  appointing  court  may decide  to  allow  the  administrator(s)  to  exercise,  on  a  residual basis,  the  powers  provided  for  to  that  end  by  its  own  law  and may, in its decision, lay down  specific conditions for the exercise  of  such  powers  in  accordance  with  that  law.

When  exercising  such  residual  powers,  however,  the  adminis­ trator(s)  shall  respect  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession  as regards the transfer of ownership of succession property, liability  for  the  debts  under  the  succession,  the  rights  of  the beneficiaries,  including,  where  applicable,  the  right  to  accept  or to  waive  the  succession,  and,  where  applicable,  the  powers  of the  executor  of  the  will  of  the  deceased.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the court appointing one or more  administrators  pursuant  to  paragraph  1  may,  by  way  of exception, where the  law  applicable to  the  succession  is  the  law of  a  third  State,  decide  to  vest  in  those  administrators  all  the powers of administration provided for by the law of the Member  State  in  which  they  are  appointed.

When exercising such powers, however, the administrators shall respect,  in  particular,  the  determination  of  the  beneficiaries  and their  succession  rights,  including  their  rights  to  a  reserved  share or  claim  against  the  estate  or  the  heirs  under  the  law  applicable to  the  succession.

## Article  30

## Special  rules  imposing  restrictions  concerning  or  affecting the  succession  in  respect  of  certain  assets

Where the law of the State in which certain immovable property, certain enterprises or other special categories of assets  are  located  contains  special  rules  which,  for  economic, family  or  social  considerations,  impose  restrictions  concerning or affecting  the  succession  in respect  of those  assets,  those special  rules  shall  apply  to  the  succession  in  so  far  as,  under the  law  of  that  State,  they  are  applicable  irrespective  of  the  law applicable  to  the  succession.

## Article  31

## Adaptation  of  rights in  rem

Where  a  person  invokes  a  right in  rem to  which  he  is  entitled under  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession  and  the  law  of  the Member State  in  which  the  right  is  invoked  does  not  know  the right in  rem in  question,  that  right  shall,  if  necessary  and  to  the extent  possible,  be  adapted  to  the  closest  equivalent  right in  rem under  the  law  of  that  State,  taking  into  account  the  aims  and the  interests  pursued  by  the  specific  right in  rem and  the  effects attached  to  it.

## Article  32

## Commorientes

Where two or more persons whose successions are governed by different  laws  die  in  circumstances  in  which  it  is  uncertain  in what order their deaths  occurred, and  where those  laws  provide differently  for  that  situation  or  make  no  provision  for  it  at  all, none  of the deceased  persons  shall have  any  rights to the succession  of  the  other  or  others.

## Article  33

## Estate  without  a  claimant

To  the  extent  that,  under  the  law  applicable  to  the  succession pursuant  to  this  Regulation,  there  is  no  heir  or  legatee  for  any assets under  a disposition of property  upon  death  and  no natural  person  is  an  heir  by  operation  of  law,  the  application of  the  law  so  determined  shall  not  preclude  the  right  of  a Member  State  or  of  an  entity  appointed  for  that  purpose  by that  Member  State  to  appropriate  under  its  own  law  the  assets of  the  estate  located  on  its  territory,  provided  that  the  creditors are  entitled  to  seek  satisfaction  of  their  claims  out  of  the  assets of  the  estate  as  a  whole.

## Article  34

## Renvoi

1. The  application  of  the  law  of  any  third  State  specified  by this  Regulation  shall  mean  the  application of  the  rules  of  law  in force  in  that  State,  including  its  rules  of  private  international law  in  so  far  as  those  rules  make  a renvoi :
2. (a) to  the  law  of  a  Member  State;  or
3. (b)  to  the  law  of  another third State which would apply its own law.
2. No renvoi shall  apply  with  respect  to  the  laws  referred  to in  Article  21(2),  Article  22,  Article  27,  point  (b)  of  Article  28 and  Article  30.

## Article  35

## Public  policy (ordre  public)

The  application  of  a  provision  of  the  law  of  any  State  specified by  this  Regulation  may  be  refused  only  if  such  application  is manifestly  incompatible  with  the  public  policy  ( ordre  public )  of the  forum.

## Article  36

## States with more than one legal system -territorial conflicts  of  laws

1. Where  the  law  specified  by  this  Regulation  is  that  of  a State  which comprises several territorial units each of which has its own  rules  of law in respect of succession, the internal conflict-of-laws  rules  of  that  State  shall  determine  the  relevant territorial  unit  whose  rules  of  law  are  to  apply.
2. In  the  absence  of  such  internal  conflict-of-laws  rules:
3. (a)  any reference to the law of the State referred to in paragraph  1 shall, for the purposes  of determining the law applicable pursuant to provisions referring to the habitual residence of the deceased, be construed as referring to the  law  of the territorial  unit  in  which  the deceased  had  his  habitual  residence  at  the  time  of  death;
4. (b)  any reference to the law of the State referred to in paragraph  1 shall, for the purposes  of determining the law applicable pursuant to provisions referring to the nationality  of  the  deceased,  be  construed  as  referring  to the law of the territorial unit with  which  the  deceased had  the  closest  connection;
5. (c)  any reference to the law of the State referred to in paragraph  1 shall, for the purposes  of determining the

law  applicable  pursuant  to  any  other  provisions  referring to  other  elements  as  connecting  factors,  be  construed  as referring  to the law  of the territorial  unit  in  which  the relevant  element  is  located.

3. Notwithstanding  paragraph  2,  any  reference  to  the  law  of the  State  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  shall,  for  the  purposes  of determining  the  relevant  law  pursuant  to  Article  27,  in  the absence of internal conflict-of-laws rules in that State, be construed  as  referring  to  the  law  of  the  territorial  unit  with which the testator or the persons whose succession is concerned  by  the  agreement  as  to  succession  had  the  closest connection.

## Article  37

## States  with  more  than  one  legal  system  -  inter-personal conflicts  of  laws

In  relation  to  a  State  which  has  two  or  more  systems  of  law  or sets  of  rules  applicable  to  different  categories  of  persons  in respect  of  succession,  any  reference  to  the  law  of  that  State shall  be  construed  as  referring  to  the  system  of  law  or  set  of rules  determined  by  the  rules  in  force  in  that  State.  In  the absence  of  such  rules,  the  system  of  law  or  the  set  of  rules with  which the  deceased  had  the  closest  connection  shall  apply.

## Article  38

## Non-application  of  this  Regulation  to  internal  conflicts  of laws

- (c) if  it  is  irreconcilable  with  a  decision  given  in  proceedings between  the  same  parties  in  the  Member  State  in  which recognition  is  sought;
- (d) if it is irreconcilable with an earlier decision given in another  Member  State  or  in  a  third  State  in  proceedings involving  the  same  cause  of  action  and  between  the  same parties, provided that the earlier decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in  the  Member State  in  which  recognition  is  sought.

Any  challenge  relating to the legal acts or legal rela­ tionships  recorded  in  an  authentic  instrument  shall  be  made before the courts having jurisdiction under this Regulation and  shall  be  decided  upon  under  the  law  applicable  pursuant to  Chapter  III.  The  authentic  instrument  challenged  shall  not produce any evidentiary effect in a Member State other than the Member  State  of  origin  as  regards  the  matter  being  challenged as  long  as  the  challenge  is  pending  before  the  competent  court.
4. If  the  outcome  of  proceedings  in  a  court  of  a  Member State  depends  on  the  determination  of  an  incidental  question relating  to  the  legal  acts  or  legal  relationships  recorded  in  an authentic  instrument  in  matters  of  succession,  that  court  shall have  jurisdiction  over  that  question.

3. The court with which an appeal is lodged under Article 50 or  Article  51  shall  refuse  or  revoke  a  declaration  of  enforce­ ability  only  if  enforcement  of  the  authentic  instrument  is  mani­ festly contrary to public policy ( ordre public )  in  the  Member State of  enforcement.

## Article  61

## Enforceability  of  court  settlements

1. Court  settlements  which  are  enforceable  in  the  Member State  of  origin  shall  be  declared  enforceable  in  another  Member State  on  the  application  of  any  interested  party  in  accordance with  the  procedure  provided  for  in  Articles  45  to  58.
