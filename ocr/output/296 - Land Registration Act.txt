- (2) Where land is according to any other law to be registered with a guaranteed title, or where land is to be registered in favour of  the  Government  of  Malta,  or  where  registration  is  sought pursuant to a transfer by the Government of Malta, it shall be registered with a guaranteed title.

2. ( a ) subject  to  any  express  provision  of  this  Act  to  the contrary,  where  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  has adjudged  that  any  person  is  entitled  to  any  right  or

interest in or to any registered land or charge, and as a consequence of such decision such court is of opinion that  a  rectification  of  the  register  is  required,  and makes an order to that effect;

- ( b ) subject  to  any  express  provision  in  this  Act  to  the contrary, where the Court of Appeal, on the application in the prescribed manner  of any person who  is aggrieved by an entry made in, or by the omission of an  entry  from,  the  register,  or  by  any  default  being made, or unnecessary delay taking place, in the making of an entry in the register, makes an order for the rectification of the register;
- ( c ) in  any  case  and  at  any  time  with  the  consent  of  all persons interested;
- ( d ) where a court of competent jurisdiction or the registrar is  satisfied  that  an  entry  in  the  register  has  been obtained  by  fraud  or  violence  and  in  the  case  of  the court,  an  order  is  made  for  the  rectification  of  the register;
- ( e ) where two or more persons, not being jointly entitled thereto,  are,  by  mistake,  registered  as  proprietors  of the  same  right  over  registered  land  or  of  the  same charge;
- ( f ) in  any  other  case  where,  by  reason  of  any  error  or omission  in  the  register,  or  by  reason  of  any  entry made under a mistake, it may be deemed just to rectify the register.
- (2) The register may be rectified under this article notwithstanding that the rectification may affect any rights, charges or interests acquired or protected by registration, or by any entry on the register, or otherwise.
- (3) The register shall not be rectified, except for the purpose of giving effect to an overriding interest, so as to affect the title of the proprietor who is in possession -
- ( a ) unless such proprietor is a party or privy or has caused or  substantially  contributed,  by  his  act,  neglect  or default, to the fraud, violence, mistake or omission in consequence of which such rectification is sought; or
- ( b ) unless the  immediate disposition to him was void, or the disposition to any person through whom he claims otherwise than under an onerous title was void; or
- ( c ) unless for any other reason, in any particular case, it is considered  that  it  would  be  unjust  not  to  rectify  the register against him.
- (4) The registrar shall obey the order of any court of competent jurisdiction in relation to any registered land on being served with t he  judgment  or  an  official  copy  thereof  accompanied  by  a statement by the Registrar of the Court certifying that the judgment has become res judicata.

- (6) Except  for  the  purpose  of  giving  effect  to  an  overriding interest, no entry in the register shall be rectified after the lapse of ten years from the date on which it is made:

Provided that nothing in this sub-article shall be construed as affecting the right of any person to claim damages from any person liable thereto.

3. (a) such  registration  has  been  made  in  violation  of  any requirement of this Act, or of any other law;
4. (b) such registration has been made in accordance with an application containing incorrect information or information which should not have led to the registration of the title;
5. (c) it results that the person in whose favour the registration  was  made  kept  hidden  from  the  registrar facts or information which were relevant to the examination to be conducted by the registrar in accordance with article 18 of this Act.
- (2) The  fact that the application which  gave  rise to the registration has been received and accepted by the registrar shall not hinder this action.
- (3) The State Advocate may exercise this action by means of a sworn application to be filed in the Civil Court, First Hall, at any time after the registration to be impugned has been made, which sworn application shall be filed against the registrar and the person in whose favour the impugned registration has been made.
- (4) An  action  filed  under  this  provision  shall  be  heard  and decided in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
- (5) Where  the  court  decides  that  the  registration  shall  be revoked, the registrar shall cancel such registration by not later than twenty (20) days from the date on which the decision becomes final.
- (6) The right  of  action  granted  to  the  State Advocate  under  this provision shall be without prejudice to any other right which third

parties may have, both under this Act as well as under any other law, to protect their rights against any registration made in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

- (5) No indemnity shall be payable under this Act in any of the following cases:
6. ( a ) where the applicant has himself caused or substantially contributed  to  the  loss  by  his  fraud  or  violence,  or derives title (otherwise than under a disposition under an onerous title which is registered or protected on the register) from a person so committing fraud or violence;
7. ( b ) where the register  is  not  rectified  in  accordance  with article 51(6);
8. ( c ) where  the  register  is  rectified  to  give  effect  to  an overriding interest;

12. ( b ) where the register is rectified, the value (if there had been no rectification)  of  the  right,  interest  or  charge, immediately before the time of rectification.
- (7) The registrar may, if the applicant desires it, and subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal, determine whether a right to indemnity has arisen under this article, and, if so, award indemnity. In the event of an appeal to the court the applicant shall not be required to pay any costs except his own, even if unsuccessful,

unless the court considers that the appeal is unreasonable.

- (8) In granting any indemnity the registrar may have regard to any costs and expenses properly incurred in relation to the matter, and may add the same to the amount of the indemnity money which would otherwise be payable.
- (9) Where indemnity is paid for a loss, the registrar, on behalf of the Government, shall be entitled to recover the amount paid from any person who has caused or substantially contributed to the loss by his fraud, violence, negligence or default, and shall be entitled to enforce any express or implied covenant, warranty or other right which the person who is indemnified would have been entitled to enforce in relation to the matter in respect of which indemnity has been paid.
- (10) Any claim to indemnity under this Act shall be enforceable only if made within five years from the date on which the right to indemnity arises, and such period shall run against all persons:

- (4) If  the  insurance  fund  is  at  any  time  insufficient  to  pay indemnity for any loss chargeable thereon, the deficiency shall, by virtue of this Act and without further assurance, be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund; but any sum so paid out of the Consolidated Fund shall be repaid out of the money subsequently standing to the credit of the insurance fund.
- (5) Accounts of the fund shall be kept and be audited as public accounts, in accordance with such regulations as the Minister responsible for finance may from time to time make.
