3. ( a ) their aggregate nominal value represents at least twenty-five percent of the nominal value of the issued share capital of the company;
4. ( b ) the aggregate voting rights attached to them represent at least twenty-five per cent of the voting rights in that company;

Provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of this subrule, where a transfer of shares in a company is a transfer referred to in article 5(9A)( d ) of the Act, such transfer shall be treated as a transfer of a controlling interest in that company:

Provided further that, notwithstanding the provisions in this subrule, where a transfer of shares in a company is a deemed transfer of a proportion of a holding as referred to in article 5(13)( b )(i) of the Act, such transfer shall not be treated as a transfer of a controlling interest in a company.

- (3) When two or more transfers of shares in the same company ("the relevant transactions") are made by the same or by related persons within a period of eighteen months or less, then, for the purpose of determining the chargeable gains arising from the last of those transfers, the relevant transfers shall be deemed to be one transfer ("the global transfer") made by the same person on the date of that last transfer, and if the global transfer satisfies any of the criteria listed in subrule (2), the following provisions shall apply:
2. ( a ) the last of the relevant transactions shall be deemed to be a transfer of a controlling interest;
3. ( b ) the  market  value  of  the  shares  transferred  in  the  last transfer  shall  be  deemed  to  be  equal  to  the  market value of the global transfer reduced by the total value that was or is to be taken into account for the purpose of  determining  the  chargeable  gain  arising  from  each of the relevant transactions preceding the last of those transfers.

- ( b ) 'A' is the percentage  of the issued share capital represented by the nominal value of those shares;
- ( c ) 'B'  is  the  percentage  of  the  total  voting  rights  in  the company represented by the total voting rights attached to those shares; and
- ( d ) 'C'  is the percentage  of  the  profits  available  for distribution  to  the  ordinary  shareholders  represented by the profits available for distribution to the holder of those shares:

## Provided that -

- (i) saving proviso (ii), for the purpose of determining  the  market  value  of  the  shares, where  the  percentage  determined  by  the  above formula has decreased as a result of a change in the  issued  share  capital  of  that  company  or  a change  in  rights  attached  to  such  shares,  made during the period of eighteen months preceding the transfer, and such change was not subject to duty under article 42B of the Duty on Documents and Transfers Act, it shall be deemed  that  such  change  had  not  taken  place and  the  market  value  of  the  shares  shall  be determined by reference to the market value of the  company and the percentage determined by the  above  formula,  calculated  by  taking  into account the values of 'A', 'B' and 'C' as existing at the time immediately preceding that change;
- (ii) the  market  value  of  shares  that  are  listed  on  a stock  exchange  recognised  under  the  Financial Markets  Act  shall  be  the  last  quoted  price  of those shares on that exchange before the date of the transfer;

The share valuation shall  be  accompanied  by  the  expert's  report which shall include a detailed description of the methods  of  valuation  which  have  been  used  in determining the market value of the shares:

Provided that the transferor shall only be authorised to submit a share valuation where:

- (v) The  Commissioner  shall  notify  his  decision  to the transferor in writing within a reasonable time of receiving the share valuation or, if he gives a notice  under  sub-rule  (iv),  within  a  reasonable time after the notice has been complied with.
- (6) The market value of a company is the total of the net asset value of the company as resulting from its financial statements for the financial year preceding that in which the transfer is made:

Provided that, where during the financial year in which the transfer is made, but not later than the date of the transfer, the company has transferred or acquired any immovable property or rights over an immovable property or any shares in another company representing at least ten percent of the nominal value of the issued share capital of that other company, the net asset value of the company shall be that resulting from an accounting statement prepared by a certified public accountant holding a practicing

certificate in auditing, to be drawn up as at the date of the transfer. The accounting statement shall consist of a balance sheet showing the position of the company as at the date of the transfer and shall be drawn up using the same methods and the same layout as used for its financial statements for the financial year preceding that in which the transfer is made:

Sohowever that where the market value as determined in accordance  with  this  rule  is  a  negative  figure,  their market value shall be taken to be zero;
- ( b ) where  the  assets  of  the  company  include  immovable property,  the  book  value  of  that  property  shall  be replaced  by  its  market  value,  that  is  to  say,  the  price that  the  property  would  fetch  if  sold  on  the  open market  on  the  date  of  the  transfer:  provided  that  this paragraph  shall  not  apply  if  the  market  value  of  the property is less than its book value;
- ( c ) the  net  asset  value  shall  be  increased  by  an  amount, representing  the  value  of  the  goodwill,  equivalent  to two  years'  average  profits  calculated  by  reference  to the profits of the company for the five financial years immediately preceding the year in which the transfer is made;
- ( d ) where the issued share capital of the company includes shares whose return is limited to a fixed rate of return, the net asset value shall be reduced by the book value of such shares:
- Provided that this paragraph shall not apply where the company has applied an amount standing to the credit of  any  of  its  reserve  accounts  funds,  other  than  a capital  redemption  reserve  and  profits  available  for distribution in paying up to any extent the allotment of the said shares.

- ( b ) where  the  company  has  not  been  in  existence  for  a sufficient period to determine the value of the goodwill in the manner stated in proviso ( c ) to subrule (6), the average profits shall be calculated by reference to the total profits for the years preceding that during which the transfer is made:

- Provided  that,  subject  to  paragraph  ( c ),  where  the transfer is made during the company's first or second financial  year  no  value  is  to  be  attributed  to  the goodwill;
- ( c ) where  the  company  has  acquired  its  business  or  part thereof from another person during the company's first three  financial  years  the  value  of  the  goodwill  of  the business so acquired shall be the higher of the consideration,  if  any,  paid  for  the  acquisition  of  the goodwill of that business and its value determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions by reference to  the  profits  derived  by  that  other  person  from  the relevant business;
- ( d ) in determining the value of the goodwill in accordance with sub-rule (6)( c ),  in  cases  where  the  provisions  of sub-rule  (6)( a )  come  into  operation,  any  dividends paid to the company out of profits for the years being considered, by another company in which the company is a shareholder, are excluded from the calculation;
- ( e ) where the value of the goodwill determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions is negative, the value that shall be taken into consideration shall be nil.
- (8) Where a controlling interest includes shares in a company that directly or indirectly owns, at the time of the transfer of those shares, immovable property there shall be allowed a deduction for the increase in inflation calculated in accordance with rule 8 in respect of that immovable property or its relevant portion:

Provided  that  no  such  deduction  for  inflation  shall  be allowed where the book value of the shares has not been replaced by their market value in accordance with proviso to sub-rule (6)( a ).

- (9) Where  a  transfer  of  a  controlling  interest  is  a  transfer  to which article 5(3)( a ) of the Act applies, the deduction allowable in t e r m s   o f   s u b r u l e   ( 8 ) ,   w h e r e   a p p l i c a b l e ,   i s   t o   b e   d e e m e d   a s satisfying the requirement for any adjustment to the value of the immovable property that may be due in terms of that article:

Provided  that  where  the  transfer  is  not  a  transfer  of  a controlling interest, the adjustment required by the said article 5(3)( a ) shall consist of an increase for inflation made in accordance with rule 8 but taking index yd  to be the index for 1991.

- (10) The transferor in any transfer of shares shall submit to the Commissioner a statement prepared by a certified public auditor stating whether the transfer is a transfer of a controlling interest or not and indicating the grounds on which this statement is based. Where the transfer is a transfer of a controlling interest, the auditor's statement shall be made on the form prescribed in Schedule C including a computation of the market value of the shares as required by these rules, and shall be accompanied, where applicable, by an architect's valuation of the market value of the immovable property taken into account in determining the value of the shares. In any other case, except as provided in sub-rule (14),

the auditor's statement shall be made on the form prescribed in Schedule D including a valuation of the shares.

- (11) The statement referred to in subrule (10) shall be delivered i n   t r i p l i c a t e   t o   t h e   C o m m i s s i o n e r   ( C a p i t a l   Tr a n s f e r   D u t y Department) and the transferor shall, together with the delivery, pay to the Commissioner the provisional tax due on the transfer in accordance with article 43 of the Income Tax Management Act, and the Commissioner shall not consider that delivery or the notice of the transfer required in accordance with the Duty on Documents and Transfers Act as valid unless payment is made as aforesaid.
- (12) The  Commissioner  shall  stamp  one  of  the  copies  of  the certificate submitted in accordance with subrule (11) in acknowledgement of the receipt of same and return it to the person who submitted it.

Provided that -

- ( a ) where the taxpayer's and the Commissioner's technical  valuations  are  produced  in  any  proceedings in  the  Administrative  Review  Tribunal,  the  Tribunal shall,  unless  the  parties  otherwise  agree,  appoint  a third  architect  to  report  on  the  value  after  examining the two valuations and inspecting the property, and the Tribunal  shall decide  the  matter  after taking  into account  the  third  architect's  report  and  any  other consideration that it may consider appropriate;
- ( b ) where, in a final and conclusive assessment, the chargeable gain on a transfer of shares is higher than that declared by the taxpayer, the excess shall not, to the extent that it is attributable to a value of immovable property as assessed exceeding the taxpayer's technical valuation by not more than twenty-five  percent,  constitute  an  omission  for  the purposes of article 56(12) of the Act.
- (14) Where the transferor is a person to whom the provisions of articles 5(2)( e ), 5(6)( e ), 5(9), 5(14)and 12(1)( c )(ii) of the Act apply, a valuation of shares or immovable property need not be made, and the statement referred to in sub-rule (10) shall be made on the form prescribed in Schedule E.

Provided further that where such person does not hold any shares in the company immediately before or after the change, the value of 'A' or 'B' in the said formula, as the case may be, shall be taken as zero:

Provided  also  that,  where  the  change  in  the  issued share capital consists of a conversion of securities, for the purpose of paragraphs ( b ) and ( c ) the market value of  shares  not  being  securities  as  defined  in  article 5(1)( b ) of the Act shall be taken as zero.

- (iii) notwithstanding paragraph (ii), where the value of 'Y' as  determined  by  the  application  of  paragraph  (i)  is higher  than  the  value  of  'Y'  as  determined  by  the application of paragraph (ii), the value of 'Y' is to be determined by the application of paragraph (i).

- (ii) On  a  subsequent  transfer  of  the  shares  held  by  the transferor  immediately before the change, the cost of acquisition  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  portion  of  the cost of acquisition not taken into account in determining the chargeable gain referred to in paragraph  (i)  of  this  subrule,  and  proviso  (ii)  of  rule 5(5) shall not apply to the said transfer.
- (iii) The  acquisition  cost  of  shares  held  by  the  transferee acquiring value referred to in subrule (1)(iii) shall be increased by the amount  referred to in the said paragraph, which shall for such purpose be treated as a positive amount, and the aggregate amount so obtained shall,  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  chargeable gain on a subsequent transfer, be the cost of acquisition of the said shares:

Provided that where the said transferee, held shares in the  company  immediately  before  the  change  in  the issued  share  capital  and  acquired  further  shares  as  a result of a change in the issued share capital consisting of an increase in the share capital of the company, the acquisition cost of the shares held and acquired shall be increased pro rata by the said amount:

Provided further that the acquisition cost of shares, not being securities as defined in article 5(1)( b ) of the Act, held by the transferee immediately before the change in  the  issued  share  capital  shall,  for  the  purpose  of determining  the  aggregate  amount  referred  to  in  this

paragraph, be taken to be zero:

Provided  also  that  this  paragraph  shall  only  apply where the said transferee acquiring value has paid the relative duty as determined in accordance with article 42  of  the  Duty  on  Documents  and  Transfers  Act  in respect of the value so acquired.

- (iv) On  a  subsequent  transfer  of  the  shares  held  by  the transferor and transferee immediately after the change, made before the end of the financial year in which the change took place, the market value taken into account in determining the chargeable gain shall, notwithstanding the provisions of rule 5, not be lower than the value of 'B' referred to in sub-rule (1)(i)( c ) of this rule, being the value that was taken into account in determining  the  value  transferred  or  acquired,  as  the case may be.

## Provided that -

- ( a ) where the assets of the partnership include shares in a company, and such shares represent at least ten percent of the nominal value of the issued share capital of that company,  their  book  value  shall  be  replaced  by  their

- market value determined in accordance with rule 5. So however that where the market value as determined in accordance  with  rule  5  is  a  negative  figure,  their market value shall be taken to be zero;
- ( b ) where the assets of the partnership include immovable property,  the  book  value  of  that  property  shall  be replaced  by  its  market  value,  that  is  to  say,  the  price that  the  property  would  fetch  if  sold  on  the  open market on the date of the transfer;
- ( c ) the  net  asset  value  shall  be  increased  by  an  amount, representing  the  value  of  the  goodwill,  equivalent  to two  years'  average  profits  calculated  by  reference  to the  profits  of  the  partnership  for  the  five  financial years  immediately  preceding  the  year  in  which  the transfer is made;
- ( d ) where the partnership has not been in existence for a sufficient period to determine the value of the goodwill  in  the  manner  stated  in  paragraph  ( c ),  the average profits shall be calculated by reference to the total profits for the years preceding that during which the transfer is made;
- ( e ) in  determining  the  value  of  the  goodwill,  in  cases where  the  provisions of  paragraph  ( a )  come  into operation, any dividends paid to the partnership out of profits  for  the  years  being  considered,  by  another company in which the partnership is a shareholder, are excluded from the calculation;
- ( f ) where the value of the goodwill determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions is negative, the value that shall be taken into consideration shall be nil.
- (5) In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership that directly or indirectly owns, at the time of the transfer of that interest, immovable property, there shall be allowed a deduction for the increase in inflation calculated in accordance with rule 8 in respect of that immovable property or its relevant portion to be determined on the percentage determined in accordance with subrule (3):

Provided  that  no  such  deduction  for  inflation  shall  be allowed where the book value of shares has not been replaced by their market value in accordance with paragraph ( a ) of the proviso of sub-rule (4).

For the purposes of this rule, "partner or partners" means any person holding an interest in a partnership.
- (2) The chargeable gain arising from the transfer referred to in sub-rule (1) shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:

Provided also that, where a person ("the transferee") acquires or increases a partnership share, any payment made outside of the partnership accounts by such person to any other partner or partners shall, where such payment exceeds the chargeable gain as determined by the said formula, be the amount chargeable to tax.

- (3) For  the  purpose  of  sub-rule  (2),  the  market  value  of  the interest in the partnership, immediately before and after the change, is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of rule 5D(3) and (4):

Provided  further  that  the  provisions  of  sub-rule  (2) shall not apply in the case where this sub-rule applies.

8. (1) The  increase  for  inflation  of  the  value  of  immovable property is to be determined by using the index of inflation established in terms of article 13 of the Housing (Decontrol) Ordinance and applying the following formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where - cost  of  acquistion/improvements  is  the  cost  as  computed  in accordance with rule 2(1)( a ) but excluding any expenses related to the deed or any duty or fees;

index yd  is the index for the year immediately preceding that in which the transfer is made;

index ya  is the index for the year immediately preceding that in which the property in question had been acquired or completed, whichever is the later, or, when it relates to improvements, for the year immediately preceding that in which the cost for carrying out the improvements was incurred:

## Provided that -

- ( a ) where, in terms of the Act, the cost of acquisition of immovable property that is transferred by a person is to be determined by reference to an acquisition happening  before  the  acquisition  of  that  property  by that person, index ya is the index for the year immediately preceding that in which the earlier acquisition took place;
- ( b ) the deduction for inflation shall not exceed -

TP - CA- D

where -

- (i) TP = the transfer price of the property
- (ii) CA  =  the  cost  of  its  acquisition,  taking  into account  any  reduction  in  the  value  of  property that may be required in terms of rule 2(4)
- (iii) D = the other deductions, excluding the deduction  for  inflation,  allowable  in  terms  of these rules.

- (2) Where  the  increase  in  inflation  is  to  be  calculated  in connection with a transfer of a controlling interest in a company in the circumstances mentioned in rule 5(8), or a transfer of an interest in a partnership, the formula referred to in sub-rule (1) shall apply subject to the following provisions:
2. ( a ) index yd is the index for the year immediately preceding that in which the said transfer is made;
3. ( b ) the  increase  is  to  be  calculated  by  reference  to  such portion of the cost of the acquisition of the immovable property as corresponds to the portion of the immovable property represented by the shares transferred;
4. ( c ) if the property was acquired or completed by the company before the interest or shares were acquired by the  transferor,  the  increase  in  inflation  computed  in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this sub-rule shall  be  reduced  by  the  amount  corresponding  to  the increase  in  inflation  from  the  date  of  the  acquisition  or completion of the property by the company or partnership to the date of the acquisition of the interest or shares by the  transferor;  and  when  the  interest  or  shares  were acquired in different years the reduction shall be calculated  up  to  each  year  of  acquisition.  The  cost  of acquisition to be taken into account in each such calculation shall be  such  percentage  of  the  cost  of acquisition of the property as corresponds to the portion of the immovable property represented by the interest or shares acquired in each year;
5. ( d ) the  deduction  for  inflation  computed  in  accordance with this subrule shall not exceed -

MV - CA - R

where -

- MV = the market value, determined in accordance with rule 5, of the portion of the  immovable  property represented by the interest or shares transferred
- CA = an equivalent portion of the cost of acquisition or completion of that property
- R = the amount of the reduction, if any, computed in accordance with paragraph ( c ).
- (3) Where  the  increase  in  inflation  is  to  be  calculated  in connection with a transfer of an immovable property acquired causa mortis after the 24th November 1992 but before the 25th November 2003, and in respect of which an adjustment to the value thereof is made in accordance with the Adjustments to Declared Value of Immovable Property Rules, index ya  shall be deemed to be the index for the year 2003.
