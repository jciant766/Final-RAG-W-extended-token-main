## TITLE I

## OF THE FORMALITIES OF NOTARIAL ACTS

25. (1) In this Act, "party" refers to the person who is a party to the negotium which is incorporated in the act and, in the case of a will, to the testator; and "appearer" means the person who appears before the notary either as a party or as the representative or agent of a party.
- (2) The  notary  shall  not  receive  a  notarial  act  except  in  the presence of the appearers.
- (3) The presence of two (2) witnesses shall be required only in the following cases:
4. (a) whenever any of the appearers so requests; and
5. (b) whenever any of the appearers does not know how or is unable to sign his name:

Provided that in the case of public wills and in the case of acts of delivery of secret wills, the notary shall in all cases inform and explain to the testator about the testator's right to have two (2) witnesses present:

Provided  further  that  in  the  case  of  public  wills  if  the testator  chooses  not  to  have  two  (2)  witnesses  present,  the notary  shall  in  the  will  declare  that  he  has  informed  and explained  to  the  testator  about  his  right  to  have  two  (2) witnesses present and that the testator chose not to have two (2) witnesses present:

Provided further that in case of acts of delivery of secret

wills if the testator chooses not to have two (2) witnesses present, the notary shall in the act of delivery declare that he has informed and explained to the testator about the testator's right to have two (2) witnesses present and that the testator chose not to have two (2) witnesses present.

- (4) It  is  the  duty  of  the  notary to direct the drawing up of the act from beginning to end, even when he causes it to be prepared by a person whom he deems trustworthy.
- (5) The notary alone is competent to ascertain the will of the appearers and to inquire, after reading over and explaining the act to them, whether it is in accordance with their will.
- (6) Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  and  any  other  law, provided no witnesses are required in terms of sub-article (3), nor does the proviso to article 34(1) or any of articles 36, 37, 38 apply, where all  the  appearers  on  the  act  declare  that  they  are  fully cognizant of the contents of the act and its annexes, they may by an express declaration exempt the notary from reading over the act to them in which case the following formalities are required:
4. ( a ) at  the  foot  of  the  act  and  before  the  final  signatures, the notary records both declarations in his  own handwriting and signs what he has recorded,
5. ( b ) immediately  following  the  notary's  signature,  each appearer  separately  writes  in  his  own  handwriting  "I confirm this exemption"  to which  he affixes his signature, and

26. The notary must personally be certain of the identity of the appearers, attestors, witnesses and interpreters. Such identity shall be ascertained by the production of the official identity card, passport or other similar official document and, where such document cannot be produced by any of the appearers, on the testimony of two attestors who may also be the witnesses appearing on the act.
27. (1) No person shall be competent as witness unless such person has attained the age of eighteen years, was born or is residing in Malta and has no interest in the act.
- (2) Saving  the  provisions  of  article  670  of  the  Civil  Code relating to public wills, the following shall not be competent as witnesses:
10. ( a ) any person who is blind or deaf or dumb;

## PART IIIB

## OF THE EXAMINATION OF TITLE

84C. (1) A notary is empowered to compile documents conducive to establishing both the title to an immovable property and the causes of preference among creditors affecting such title. He has the right to interpret the compiled documents and give advice  thereon. In  this  Act,  this  process  of  compilation, interpretation and advice is referred to as "the examination of title" or cognate expressions.

- (2) Without  prejudice  to  his  responsibility  in  terms  of  this article, the notary shall have the right to delegate any or all of these powers to persons he deems trustworthy.
- (3) The  examination  of  title  shall  be  carried  out  in  terms  of regulations made under this article.
- (4) A notary may examine title whenever he is instructed to do so by a written contract of engagement whose requisites shall be laid down by regulations.
- (5) A  notary  who  publishes  a  notarial act of transfer of ownership of immovable property or other real rights over such property shall be deemed to have been instructed by the transferee to examine its title:

Provided that the transferee may, by an express declaration recorded in the notarial act, exempt the notary from the obligation imposed on him in terms of this sub-article or limit the extent of such obligation in any way the transferee deems fit:

Provided  further  that  regulations  may  list  the  instances where a notary shall be exempt from examining the title, and the notary shall mention in the act that he is so exempt:

Provided  further  that  regulations  may  list  the  instances where and the conditions under which a notary may refuse to examine title, and  the  notary  shall  mention  in  the  act  all  the relevant details.

- (6) Where  a  notary  publishes  a notarial act containing  a transaction other than the transfer of ownership of immovable property or  other  real  rights  over  such  property,  or where  he authenticates a private writing containing a transaction referring to such property, his obligation to examine title shall arise if, and to the extent that, specific regulations are made with regard thereto.

## (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or any law:

- ( a ) a  notary's  responsibility  for  the  examination  of  title shall be regulated by, and be strictly interpreted according  to,  this  article  and  the  regulations  made

thereunder;

- ( b ) where  a  notary  examines  title  he  shall  exercise  the diligence  required  by  the  regulations  referred  to  in paragraph ( a );
- ( c ) where he examines title in terms of the regulations, he shall be deemed to have acted with due diligence;
- ( d ) only the following persons may bring an action against a  notary  in  connection  with  the  examination  of  title which he has carried out:
- (i) the  person  with  whom  he  has  entered  into  a contract  of  engagement  in  terms  of  sub-article (4),
- (ii) the transferee referred to in sub-article (5), or
- (iii) the  persons  indicated  in  regulations  which  may be made in terms of sub-article (6).
- ( e ) Where  a  notary  is  deemed  to  have  been  engaged  to examine title by the transferee or has been engaged to examine title by any person, the said Notary may not, without  the  prior  consent  of  the  transferee  or  person who  engaged  him,  be  questioned  on  any  matter  in reference  to  the  said  examination  of  title,  or  on  a property title report, or on any communication related thereto, nor may the notary be constrained to produce any  document  which  is  not  available  publicly,  or  to disclose in any manner a matter or information which may  have  come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  notary  in professional confidence or in his professional capacity.
- (8) (a) Where a notary receives instructions in terms of subarticle (4) or where he is bound to examine title in terms of this article, he shall inform the transferee in any manner, including through verbal communication, of those facts and findings resulting from the searches and those reservations which he is specifically required to mention in terms of the regulations made under this article.
- (b) Unless  the  transferee  has  already  made  a  declaration  in terms of the first proviso to sub-article (5) exempting the notary from examining the title, or where the notary records in the act in terms of the second proviso thereto that he is exempt from examining title, or the notary records in the act in terms of the third proviso thereto that he is authorized to refuse to examine title, the notary shall be deemed to have been instructed by the transferee to examine title.
- (9) The notary shall be the owner of the documents he compiles for the examination of title and shall preserve them for a period of five years. Such period shall run from the date agreed upon in the contract of engagement or if no such date was agreed upon from the date of the contract of engagement or in default from the date of the deed where the examination was made in terms of sub-article (4), and from the date of publication of the act where the examination was made in terms of sub-articles (5) or (6) and, in the case of a private  writing referred  in  sub-article  (6),  from  the  date  it  is

- (11) Nothing in this article shall preclude the notary from being engaged only to compile any of the documents referred to in subarticle (1), or to interpret or give advice on such documents which he or a third party has compiled, but this shall not be deemed to be the examination of title as defined in this article. Such a service shall be regulated by an ad hoc contract of engagement made in terms of regulations made under this article.
- (12) The Minister responsible for notarial affairs shall from time to time make regulations, after consulting the Notarial Council, prescribing any matter referred to in this article including, but not limited to:
