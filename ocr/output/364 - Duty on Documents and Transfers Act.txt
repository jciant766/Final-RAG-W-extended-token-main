The Commissioner or his duly authorised officer may require the holder of a document protected by professional secrecy to communicate to him an abstract of the document so as to remove references to any information protected by professional secrecy.

collection of duty under this Act or for the purpose, or in the course of an investigation or a prosecution for any offence committed against  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  or  in  the  course  of  an investigation or prosecution for any relevant offence.

For the purposes of this sub-article, "relevant offence" means a criminal offence, not being one of an involuntary nature, consisting of any act or omission which if committed in Malta, or in corresponding circumstances, would constitute an offence liable to the punishment of imprisonment or of detention for a term of one (1) year or more.

he  shall  be  liable  to  imprisonment  from  thirteen  months  to  three years.

- (2) The  same  punishment  established  in  sub-article  (1)  shall apply to any person who without lawful authority makes use of any genuine die, mark or other instrument used by the Government or under its authority to denote the payment of duty.
21. In the crimes referred to in article 20, any of the offenders who shall, prior to the commencement of any proceedings, give information  thereof  to  the  Commissioner  of  Police  or  other competent authorities shall be exempted from punishment.

or the transfer of a partnership interest for consideration from a company or partnership to another company or partnership, where the transferor and the transferee form part of the same group of companies,  or  where  any  or  both  of  them  are partnerships, would have been considered to form part of the same group if they had been a company or companies:

Provided further that where any company referred to in the immediately preceding proviso is a "property company", the immediately preceding proviso shall only apply where the individual, direct or indirect, beneficial owners of the companies referred to in the said proviso are the same and each such individual holds, directly or indirectly,  substantially  the  same  percentage  interest  in the nominal share capital and voting rights in each of the said  companies  both  before  and  after  the  transfer  or exchange, as the case may be. The provisions of article 32(6)( b ) shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purpose of making such determination.

For the purpose of this proviso "property company" shall have the same meaning assigned to it in article 2(1) of the Income Tax Act but the provisos to the said definition shall not apply:

Provided also that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply, where the said companies are, directly or indirectly, owned as to eighty percent or more by a company whose securities are listed on a stock exchange  recognised  by  the  Commissioner  for  the purpose of this provision;

- (ii) companies which are controlled and beneficially owned  directly  or  indirectly  to  the  extent  of more than fifty per cent by the same shareholders:

Provided  that  the  Minister  may  by  rules  prescribe  another definition of "group of companies" and that definition shall apply to transfers made after such date as may be prescribed by those rules.

- (2) ( a ) Where it  results  that  seventy-five  percent  or  more  of the  assets,  excluding  all  current  assets other  than immovable property, of the company referred to in article  42B  or  of  the  company  whose  marketable securities are transferred inter vivos or are transmitted causa mortis in  respect  of  persons  from  whom the transfer causa mortis originates who died on or after the  1st January  2000,  consists  of  any  immovable property or any right over an immovable, the duty chargeable  in  virtue  of sub-article  (1)  shall  be increased by three euro for every one hundred euro or part thereof of the amount or value of the consideration or the real value of the marketable security, whichever is the higher.
2. ( b ) Where  the  company  referred  to  in  article  42B,  or whose  marketable  securities  are transferred holds, directly  or  indirectly,  shares  in  a  company  having seventy-five  percent  or  more  of  its  assets,  excluding

Cap. 123.

all current assets other  than  immovable  property, consisting  of  any  immovable  property  or  any  right over  an  immovable,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the "property  company",  the  duty  chargeable  in  virtue  of sub-article  (1)  shall  be  increased  by  three  euro  for every one hundred euro or part thereof of the amount or  value  of  the  consideration  or  the  real  value  of  the marketable security, whichever is the higher:

Provided that paragraph ( b ) shall only apply where the aggregate value of:

- (i) immovable property or any right over an immovable  owned  by  a  property  company  or companies  (as  represented  by  the  percentage interest  held  in  such  company  or  companies), and
- (ii) immovable property or any right over an immovable owned by the company referred to in article  42B  or  whose  marketable  securities  are transferred,

is equal to or exceeds seventy-five percent of the total non-current assets of the property company or companies  (as  represented  by  the  percentage  interest held  in  such  company  or  companies)  and  of  the company referred to in article 42B or whose marketable securities are transferred, disregarding the book value of shares held, directly or indirectly, in the property company or companies and taking into account  total  current  assets  consisting  of  immovable property:

Provided  further  that  paragraph  ( b )  shall  not  apply where the duty chargeable in virtue of sub-article (1) has been increased by three euro for every  one hundred  euro or part thereof in accordance  with paragraph ( a ).

- ( c ) For  the  determining  of  the  amount  or  value  of  the consideration  or  the  real  value  of  the  marketable security or of the real value of the company referred to in article 42B, there shall not be deducted any liability in excess of the value of all assets excluding the value of  any  such  immovable  property  or  any  real  right thereon other than -
- (i) a  bank  loan  relating  to  the  cost  of  acquisition and improvements of the immovable property or real right thereon; or
- (ii) a  debt  registered at the Public Registry relating to the acquisition cost of the aforesaid immovable, where such debt is registered within three months from the date of acquisition of the said immovable,

proved in each case by the production of such documents to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, as

the Commissioner may require:

Provided that where the aforesaid immovable has been acquired  from  a  group  company  and  such  transfer qualified for duty relief under article 32(6), the date of acquisition  taken  into  account  in  determining  whether the  debt  is  registered  within  three months  as aforesaid shall be the date when the immovable was acquired by the said group company:

Provided  also  that  for  the  purpose  of  this  paragraph, where the company  has in issue any marketable securities consisting of shares which do not participate in any way in the profits of the company other than by way  of  a  fixed  rate  of  return,  which  resulted from a conversion of debt, other than a debt referred to in subparagraph  (ii),  such marketable  securities shall  be treated as a liability.
