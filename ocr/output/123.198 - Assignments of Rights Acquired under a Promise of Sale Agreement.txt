4. (1) In the computation of the income derived from an assignment  to  which  these  rules  apply,  deductions  shall  only  be allowable in respect of the following expenses, to the extent that they are incurred by the assignor and are not reimbursed or reimbursable by any other person:
2. (a) brokerage fees in respect of the said assignment;
3. (b) where the assignor was not a party to the promise of  sale  in  question  but  had  acquired  his  rights  from  another person in terms of a previous valid assignment, the consideration,  if  any,  which  he  may  have  paid  to  that  other person  for  the  acquisition  of  those  rights  in  terms  of  that previous assignment.
- (2) The  expenses  mentioned  in  sub-rule  (1)  shall  not  be allowable as a deduction unless:
5. (a) the  assignor  produces  to  the  notary  or  advocate who  authenticates  the  written  agreement  a  signed  receipt  that shows the date of the payment, the name, identification document  number  and  address  of  the  person  to  whom  the payment was made and the amount paid;
6. (b) as  regards  the  payment  of  a  consideration  for  a previous assignment as mentioned in sub-rule (1)(b), the assignor of the subsequent assignment also produces to the said notary  or  advocate  a  copy  of  the  agreement  under  which  the previous assignment had been made;
7. (c) the  said  notary  or  advocate  records  the  details mentioned in paragraph (a) in the notice of the assignment and produces  to  the  Commissioner,  together  with  that  notice,  a certified copy of the receipt mentioned in paragraph (a) as well as, where applicable, a certified copy of the previous assignment mentioned in paragraph (b).
5. (1) When  the  consideration for an  assignment to which  these  rules  apply  does  not  exceed  one-hundred  thousand  euro (€100,000),  the  income  derived  from  that  assignment,  computed  in accordance with rule 4, shall be subject to tax at the rate of fifteen euro cents (€0.15) for every euro or part thereof.
- (2) The tax mentioned in sub-rule (1) shall be final and shall be  separate  and  distinct  from  that  paid  or  payable  under  any  other provisions of the Act or of the Income Tax Management Act. It shall not be available as a credit against the tax liability of any other person or as a refund.

- (3) The  income  derived  from  an  assignment  mentioned  in sub-rule  (1)  shall  not  form  part  of  the  total  income  of  the  person deriving  that  income.  Any  loss  that  may  be  incurred  in  any  such assignment shall not be available by way of deduction from or set off against income derived from any other assignment or from any other source. When the assignor is an individual, he shall not be required to disclose that income in any return made pursuant to article 10 of the Income  Tax  Management  Act.  When  the  assignor  is  a  company resident in Malta, it shall allocate the distributable profits derived from the assignment to its final tax account.
- (4) The  tax  chargeable  on  the  income  derived  from  an assignment mentioned in sub-rule (1) shall be due by the assignor and shall be paid to the notary or advocate who authenticates the relative written agreement. The said notary or advocate shall remit the tax to the Commissioner  within twenty-one (21) days of the relative assignment  and,  in  default,  shall  be  liable  for  the  tax  jointly  and severally with the assignor:

Provided that the liability of the said notary or advocate in terms of this rule shall be limited to the amount of tax payable by reference to the information provided by the parties as recorded in the notice of the assignment.

6. When the consideration for an assignment to which these rules  apply  exceeds  one-hundred  thousand  euro  (€100,000),  the  first one-hundred  thousand  euro  (€100,000)  shall  constitute  the  final  tax portion  and  the  amount  by  which  the  consideration  exceeds  onehundred thousand euro (€100,000) shall constitute the excess portion. The deductions allowable in terms of rule 4 shall be apportioned and tax shall be chargeable separately on each of the two (2) portions as provided for in rules 7 and 8.
7. (1) The  deduction  allowable  against  the  final  tax portion  is  the  amount  obtained  by  multiplying  the  total  deductions allowable in terms of rule 4 by one-hundred thousand (100,000) and dividing the result by the full consideration.
- (2) The  tax  on  the  final  tax  portion,  after  the  deduction mentioned in sub-rule(1), shall be charged at the rate of fifteen euro cents (€0.15) for every euro or part thereof.
- (3) The provisions of sub-rules (2), (3) and (4) of rule 5 shall apply to the tax chargeable under this rule in the same manner as they apply to the tax on an assignment mentioned in rule 5(1).
8. (1) The deduction allowable against the excess portion  is  an  amount  equivalent  to  the  difference  between  the  total deductions allowable in respect of the assignment in question in terms of rule 4 and the deduction allowable in accordance with rule 7(1).

- (2) The excess portion, after the deduction mentioned in subrule  (1),  shall  form  part  of  the  assignor's  chargeable  income  for  the year  of  assessment  in  question  and  shall  be  subject  to  tax  at  the appropriate  rate  or  rates  in  terms  of  article  56  of  the  Act.  It  shall represent income to which article 4(1)(a) of the Act applies and shall be disclosed as such by the assignor in a return filed in accordance with the  provisions  of  the  Income  Tax  Management  Act  together  with  his other income.
- (3) An amount equivalent to seven percent (7%) of the excess portion after the deduction mentioned in sub-rule (1) shall be payable by  the  assignor  by  way  of  provisional  tax  on  account  of  the  tax chargeable in accordance with this rule. The said provisional tax shall be  paid  to  the  notary  or  advocate  who  authenticates  the  relative agreement  in  writing  in  addition  to  the  tax  payable  on  the  final  tax portion.
- (4) The said notary or advocate shall remit the provisional tax collected in accordance with sub-rule (3) to the Commissioner within twenty-one (21) days of the relative assignment together with the tax collected in accordance with rule 5 and, in default, shall be liable for the tax jointly and severally with the assignor:

9. (1) For  the  purpose  of  rule  6,  in  determining  if  the consideration  for  the  assignment  exceeds  one-hundred  thousand  euro (€100,000):
3. (a) when  rights  are  assigned  to  two  (2)  or  more persons  conjointly  or  in  undivided  parts,  the  value  of  the consideration shall be deemed to be the total consideration paid or payable by all those persons;
4. (b) when  rights  are  assigned  by  two  (2)  or  more persons  conjointly  or  in  undivided  parts,  the  value  of  the consideration shall be deemed to be the total consideration paid or payable to all those persons;
5. (c) when rights acquired under a promise of sale are assigned by means of more than one (1) transaction entered into between the same parties, the said rights shall be deemed to have been  assigned  by  means  of  one  (1)  assignment  for  the  total

consideration paid or payable in terms of all the transactions in questions.

- (2) This rule is without prejudice to article 51 of the Act.
10. The provisions of article 19 of the Income Tax Management Act shall apply to a person who makes an assignment to which these rules apply in the same manner as they apply to any other person carrying on a trade, business, profession or vocation.
11. (1) Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  the  foregoing rules, when income derived from an assignment to which these rules apply, including income derived from a transaction intended to be an assignment of rights acquired under a promise of sale of immovable property situated in Malta as referred to in article 5A(2)(d) of the Act but which, in terms of rule 3, is not a valid assignment, has not been reported or has not been reported fully and correctly in a notice of the assignment  furnished  to  the  Commissioner,  the  full  amount  of  that income  shall  be  charged  to  tax  at  the  rate  of  thirty-five  euro  cents (€0.35) on every euro of that income.
- (2) The  tax  chargeable  in  accordance  with  sub-rule  (1), reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  tax  that  may  have  been  paid  in connection  with  the  assignment  in  question  in  accordance  with  the other  provisions  of  these  rules,  shall  be  payable  upon  demand  with interest as provided in article 44(2A) of the Income Tax Management Act, which interest shall be deemed to have commenced running from the date of the assignment. The provisions of rule 5(2) shall apply to any tax chargeable in accordance with this rule.
- (3) A person who is served with a demand for payment of tax  determined  in  accordance  with  this  rule  shall  have  the  rights  of objection  and  appeal  in  the  same  manner  as  a  person  served  with  a notice  of  an  assessment  made  under  article  31  of  the  Income  Tax Management Act.
12. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions,  the  income derived from an assignment to which these rules apply that is made after  the  31st  December  2020  but  not  later  than  the  31st  December 2022,  shall  be  subject  to  tax  at  the  rate  mentioned  in  rule  5  and  in accordance with the provisions of that rule, regardless of the amount of the consideration for that assignment and without reference to rules 6, 7, 8 and 9.
