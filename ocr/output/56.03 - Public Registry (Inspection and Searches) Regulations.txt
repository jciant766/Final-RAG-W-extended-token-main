- of  the  Act  or  kept  by  the  Public  Registry  under  any other law, in which case the Director shall also deliver a  copy  of  the  relative  entries,  when  so  requested  by any other person, for the purposes of verifying searches issued before the appointed day.
- (2) The  officer  in  charge  shall  duly  authenticate  manually  or electronically as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, the draft and upon such authentication, the draft shall be deemed authenticated.
- (3) The  Director  shall  endorse  the  drafts  of  the  certificates, lists  or  copies  mentioned in sub-regulation (1), unless there is sufficient reason to withhold such endorsement and on such an endorsement, the certificate, list or copy shall be deemed to have been compiled in terms of the Act, and for the purposes of the Act, each application shall have a unique order number which shall be reproduced in the certificate.
- (4) Where an official search is required in terms of article 28 of the Act,  and  the  applicant  limits  such  search  in respect  of  a particular property, or where the applicant requests that the search should not include records having the same search parameters as requested, but with different maternity, the documents supplied by the Director shall not be considered as a certificate in terms of these regulations or in terms of article 26 of the Act.
- (5) The Director shall, unless circumstances otherwise require, make available the certificates within the times specified herein, but in no case earlier than two working days:
- ( a ) in the case of a search into public wills, the certificate shall  be  ready  or  sent  by  post  within  seven  working days;
- ( b ) when  the  application  is  a  new  search,  the  certificate shall be made available within ten working days;
- ( c ) when the application refers to an updating, the certificate shall be made available within three working days;
- ( d ) when the application refers to verification of searches issued, the certificate, together  with  the  lists  and records submitted with the application in terms of the Second  Schedule, shall be made  available within eighteen  working  days,  so  however  that  where  the verification is limited to the checking and certification of  notes  of  reference  in  respect  of  particular  notes  of preference  not forming  part of an official  search application,  the  certificate  shall  be  made  available within seven working days;
- ( e ) any regular client may reach an arrangement with the Director whereby such regular client will be entitled to submit, on good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the Director, an application for a new search or for

updating, as referred to respectively in paragraphs ( b ) and  ( c ),  and  when  the  regular  client  makes  such  a request,  the  Director  may,  notwithstanding  what  is stated in this sub-regulation, make available,

- (i) the new search within three working days; and
- (ii) a  computer  print-out  of  the  lists,  relating  to  a period of thirty days prior to two working days from date  of  order,  compiled  from  the  indexes, on the next following working day, or, where the request is made before 9.00 a.m., by noon of the same day, while the relative copies will be made available within two working days,

and in such case, the regular client shall pay double the total  fees  normally  due,  provided  that  where  any period  herein-mentioned  is  not  respected,  including those instances where the provisions of sub-regulation (6)  apply,  the  regular  client  shall  only  pay  the  fee established  in  Section  C  of  the  First  Schedule  of  the Public Registry Act, even if the search or updating is ready  before  any  period  mentioned  in  paragraphs  ( b ) and ( c ).

- (6) The  time  periods  mentioned  in  the  preceding  subarticle shall  commence  from  the  day  following  the  receipt  of the application, but the Director may, on good cause being shown, not adhere to such time periods and shall in such case inform the applicant accordingly. Where the amount of entries within the same group, excluding common notes, exceeds thirty in number, this fact, in itself, constitutes a good cause for the purposes of this subarticle.
7. The  Director  may,  by  notice  in  the  Gazette,  designate special  periods,  not  being  more  than  three  in  number  in  each calendar  year  and  each  period  not  being  longer  than  five consecutive  working  days,  during  which  the  time  periods mentioned in regulation 6(5) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of the said sub-regulation, commence to run from the first working day following the said special period. The twenty-four hour period mentioned in regulation 5(4) shall likewise so commence.
8. (1) Any regular client ordering official searches via electronic mail, may reach an agreement with the Director whereby the Director binds himself to inform the applicant whenever the number of entries in the search result will probably exceed such number as may have been agreed, and in any such case, any search submitted by the applicant which exceeds the established number shall be held in abeyance for a maximum period of seven days from the date of application.
- (2) Where the applicant  fails  to  confirm  the  order,  the  search application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn, but in such case the minimum application fee established in paragraph C1 of the First Schedule to the Act shall still be due.
- (3) Where the order is confirmed within the seven-day period mentioned in sub-regulation (1) -

- (2) Fees  may  be  paid  and  transmitted  by  electronic  means  in terms of arrangements made with the Director.
