- (d) Collaborate  with  other  entities  whatsoever,  in  such  a  manner  as  to reduce the notary's impartiality or independence;

- (f) Authorise,  instruct,  or  allow  third  parties  to  put  pressure  on  other persons  to  use  his  or  her  services.  Furthermore,  the  notary  shall  be obliged  to  immediately  ask  such  third  parties  to  desist  from  such actions, should the notary find out that third parties have done so even without  the  notary's  acquiescence.  In  any  case,  the  notary  shall  be obliged to immediately inform the Notarial Council and, if applicable, the third parties' representative body/bodies, of such actions.

## Title 3:    Of Professional Relationships

- 3.1 Relationship with colleagues
- 3.1 In his relationship with other notaries, a notary is bound to act according to the principles of loyalty, respect, fairness, generosity, solidarity and co-operation, and  with  the  intent  of  raising  the  prestige  and  the  public  significance  of  the profession. Any manifestation of vanity and disloyal competitiveness should be avoided.
- 3.2 The following are rules that shall govern the relationship between notaries:
- (a) A  notary  shall  inform  his  colleague,  in  a  professional  and  respectful manner,  of  any  possible  errors  or  omissions  which  he  believes  his colleague has committed.
- (b) A  notary  shall  strive  for  the  correction  of  errors,  inaccuracies  or  any other omissions in his or her work within a reasonable time whenever he is requested to do so by a colleague. This shall also apply in cases where it  is  legally  possible  for  such  corrections  to  be  carried  out  by  another notary, but where it would be easier for such corrections to me made by the  notary  who  has  made  such  omissions in  view  of  the  fact  that  such notary  already  has  a  professional  relationship  with  the  parties  whose signature is required.
- (c) Any dispute or difference of opinion which arises between notaries shall be settled with the assistance of the Notarial Council.
- (d) A  notary  shall  provide  copies  of  notarial  deeds  and  documents  to  his colleagues whenever requested within a reasonable time-frame, ideally within a period of ten (10) working days from the day of the request. This time limit applies most specifically to notarial deeds which have not been deposited by the notary at the Notarial Archives.
- (e) A notary is bound to exchange his systematic views and information with colleagues. If consulted by a colleague, a notary must give his opinion and  recommendations  within  a  reasonable  time,  depending  on  the urgency of the situation.
- (f) A  notary  is  bound  to  replace  his  colleague,  who  due  to  any  serious impediment or illness, cannot receive certain acts. In this eventuality, the notary shall be entitled to verify and ascertain for himself the will of the parties and other matters as he deems fit.
- (g) A notary shall not betray the good faith or breach the trust of a colleague, or manifest in any manner disloyal practices towards a colleague.
- (h) A notary shall refrain from expressing critical opinions in relation to his colleagues  in  the  presence  of  third  parties,  including  other  colleagues, clients,  state  authorities  and  institutions,  as  this  may  compromise  the good reputation of the profession in general or of a particular colleague by discrediting the competence, knowledge and service of another notary. A notary may however give objective technical advice on the work of a

colleague if the particular method or procedure employed or adopted by such other notary is not legally correct. In doing so the notary must be objective and professional and must refrain from passing criticism of a personal nature directed at his colleague.

- (i) In cases of collaboration with another notary or with another professional, a notary must maintain his professional independence and shall not perform any task that goes contrary to what is professionally ethical.
- (j) When a notary is requested by a client to render services which have already  been  requested  from  and  commenced  by  another  notary,  he shall, before accepting to render any services, inform the client to settle any dues with his colleague. The notary shall also personally inform his colleague and shall collect any fees and expenses due to him.
- (k) A notary may not collaborate with another notary, whose warrant has been rescinded or temporarily suspended, by signing any notarial deeds or any other documents drawn up by that notary, or by rendering any services whatsoever in collaboration with such notary.
- (l) A notary shall refrain from trying to employ any employees who are already employed by a colleague. Moreover, a notary shall inform his colleague of his intention to employ an employee who was previously employed by another notary.

## 3.2 Relationship with the Notarial Council

- 3.2.1 The  notary  shall  cooperate  with  the  Notarial  Council  in  the  most  ample manner and shall provide the Notarial Council with any information requested by it in the performance of its duties, within the time stipulated by the Notarial Council,  and  the  notary  shall  provide  timely  assistance  as  requested  during any inquiry into the notary's conduct.
- 3.2.2 The notary is expected to attend the Annual General Meeting of the Notarial College and to attend seminars organised by the Notarial Council.
- 3.2.3 Members of the Notarial Council shall:
- (a) perform their functions with dedication and commitment;
- (b) perform their functions with impartiality and strict confidentiality;
- (c) where  a  conflict  of  interest  arises,  raise  such  issue  before  the  other members of the Notarial Council, and refrain from getting involved in that particular matter;
- (d) attend Notarial Council meetings;
- (e) promote and encourage collegiality between notaries;
- (f) assign  specific  tasks  to  other  notaries  who  are  not  members  of  the Notarial Council if they are of the opinion that such notaries, although

not Council members, may contribute to the development and improvement of the notarial profession in general.

## 3.3 Relationship with Public Authorities

- 3.3.1 In  his  relationship  with  public  authorities  and  institutions,  the  notary  must perform  his  duties  in  a  professional  manner  in  a  way  which  attracts  a  high regard to the notarial profession.
- 3.3.2 A notary shall not seek, in any manner, the employment or collaboration of civil servants against payment or compensation of any kind.
- 3.3.3 In  case  of  dispute,  a  notary  shall  not  take  individual  action  against  public authorities  and  institutions  without  primarily  consulting  with  the  Notarial Council.

## 3.4 Relationship with clients

- 3.4.1 In  the  performance  of  his  duties  towards  his  clients,  the  notary  shall  act diligently and professionally. He shall display reasonable availability towards his clients and maintain efficiency throughout the whole notary-client relationship, in particular keeping the clients informed and updated throughout the whole notary-client relationship.
- 3.4.2 The advice a notary should give to his client must be disinterested, frank and honest.  A  notary  must  inform  and  make  all  parties  acquainted  with  the applicable legal provisions and while ascertaining that the will of the parties is reflected  in  the  notarial  deed,  he  must  ensure  the  legitimacy  of  the  notarial deed, and must provide the parties with impartial and correct legal advice to assist them in taking the right decisions.
- 3.4.3 A notary should give all the necessary information required by the client and assist the client in taking a fully informed decision.
- 3.4.4 A notary should render account to his client whenever it is so requested.
- 3.4.5 A  notary  shall  always  act  impartially  and  shall  perform  his  functions  in  the common interest  of  all  parties  concerned.  He  shall  refrain  from  offering  his services, especially in instances where his impartiality is imperative, in cases where a conflict of interest exists or could arise. There shall be deemed to be a conflict of interest in all situations where a notary is inclined to favour some of the parties to the detriment of the other parties and his fidelity to both parties may be seriously affected.
- 3.4.6 A notary shall not pay or receive any benefit from either of the parties or from any third parties (such as estate agents and architects), in connection with the practise  of  his  professional  duties.  Such  payments  give  rise  to  a  conflict  of interest and renders the notary unimpartial in the performance of his duties.
- 3.4.7 Being  a  public  officer  and  not  merely  an  independent  professional,  a  notary may not cease to act on behalf of a client except in cases where he has a valid cause, such as loss of confidence between the notary and the client, conflict of interest or a situation which renders his professional independence

questionable, inducement by a client to perform illegal, unfair or fraudulent acts and clients who refuse to pay the notary whenever he renders a service.

- 3.4.8 In cases where a notary assumes particular duties which go beyond the normal practice, the notary has a duty to inform the client regarding the scope of the responsibility which he is assuming.
- 3.5 Relationship with trainee notaries and with employees
- 3.5.1 A notary is bound to provide trainee notaries with legal training and to ensure that  they  receive  adequate notarial practice  according to law. In so doing, a notary is bound to acquaint trainee notaries with the fundamental principles of the profession and with the principles of professional ethics.
- 3.5.2 A  notary  must  involve  trainee  notaries  in  every  aspect  of  the  notarial profession in such a way as to equip such trainee notaries with the abilities required to perform the duties and functions of the notarial profession.
- 3.5.3 The notary must inform the trainee notaries that they are also bound by the rules and principles of this Code of Ethics.
- 3.5.4 A notary is also bound to ensure that his employees are adequately trained and equipped to perform their duties in a professional manner. Moreover, a notary must as a general rule refrain from having his trainee notaries and employees act  as  mandatories  in  notarial  deeds  received  by  him  to  safeguard  the fundamental principle of impartiality.

## Title 4:   Of Unlawful Competition

- 4.1 Notaries  are  obliged  to  restrain  from  unfair  competition,  which  includes without limitation:
- 4.2 A  notary's  co-operation  and  over  association  with  certain  individuals  who pressure clients to choose that particular notary in order to receive some sort of financial aid
- 4.3 Gaining clients by reducing the notarial tariff fixed by law irrespective of the service rendered.
- 4.4 Gaining clients by concluding transactions which  are motivated by a consideration (causa) which is immoral, illegal or goes against public policy.
- 4.5 Any form of persuasive practises used by a notary in order to attract a person to use his or her services in the future, including any request or suggestion to a person that any notarial acts required by him in the future should be made only at his or her notarial office.
- 4.6 Concealment of any documents which should be made known to his or her colleagues in order to facilitate or improve their work.
- 4.7 A notary omits certain behaviours which are part of his or her fundamental duties and as a result produces hasty work to the detriment of both his or her clients and his or her colleagues.

| 4.9.1 | It shall be lawful for a notary to put up an electronic website whereby he gives general information about his or her office hours and the location of his or her office.

| 4.9.2 | Participation or cooperation in broadcast television programmes, radio programmes or writing articles in newspaper columns, concerning both his or her profession and any other event open to the public (even if it contributes to his fame via the means of mass communication), shall not be treated primarily as tools for advertising his or her capabilities as a notary or any other specialisation relating to his or her notarial profession.

| 5.1   | Even though a Notary is a Public Official and gives Public faith to acts inter vivos and once these acts are published he or she is duty bound to give copies of these acts when requested or obliged by the act itself, any other act causa mortis (not being a declaration causa mortis) and any other private writings (including preliminary agreements), advice (including title reports) and conversations shall be subject to strict observance of professional secrecy as defined by the Professional Secrecy Act and as defined by other legislation including the Data Protection Act and notarial practice. |
| 5.2   | This obligation shall bind the Notary during and after the completion of is work, except giving copies as stated in five point one (5.1) above, and in the other matters mentioned in five point one (5.1) above, even after the death of the persons performing said act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
