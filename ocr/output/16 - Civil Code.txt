Provided  that  the  court  may  decide  on  the  demand  where the applicant or the respondent or both the applicant and the respondent fail to appear on the day of the hearing.

- (4) The  decree  referred to in sub-article (3) shall be  an executive title deemed to be included amongst the decrees mentioned in article 253( a ) of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure and shall be enforceable in the same manner and under the same conditions in which such acts are executed.
- (5) The  decree  referred  to  in  sub-article  (3)  shall  cease  to  be enforceable if the action for separation is not instituted within two months of the date of the decree or within such longer period as the court may in the same or in a subsequent decree allow.
- (6) The provisions of article 381 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure in pursuance of which a court of contentious jurisdiction may make the order therein specified shall apply, mutatis mutandis , as if the court in that sub-article were a reference to the appropriate section of the Civil Court before which the demand referred to in the proviso to sub-article (1) is made.
- (7) The decree and the order mentioned in this article may be only reviewed, altered or revoked upon an application made by the party seeking such review, alteration or revocation.

39. Where a law suit for personal separation has been filed by either spouse, or a law suit for access, and, or, care and custody of children has been filed, even when the parents are not married, and evidence of acts of domestic violence has been produced, the court may, either on an application of one of the parties or on its own motion in order to protect the safety of the parties involved or in the best interests of the child or children or of any other minor dependants of any of the spouses, issue a protection order under article 412C of the Criminal Code and, or a treatment order under article 412D of the same Code and the provisions of those articles shall mutatis mutandis apply to an order issued under this article as if it were an order issued under the corresponding article of the said Code.
40. Either of the  spouses  may  demand  separation  on  the grounds of excesses, cruelty, threats or grievous injury on the part of the other against the plaintiff, or against any of his or her children, or on the ground that the spouses cannot reasonably be expected to live together as the marriage has irretrievably broken down:

Provided  that  the  court  may  pronounce  separation  on  the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down notwithstanding that, whether previously to or after the coming into force of this article, none of the spouses had made a demand on such ground.

41. Either  of  the  spouses  may  also  demand  separation  if,  for two years or more, he or she shall have been deserted by the other, without good grounds.
42. (1) The action for separation shall be extinguished by the reconciliation of the spouses.
- (2) Nevertheless,  where  a  fresh  ground  for  separation  arises, the plaintiff may in support of his demand also allege the previous grounds.
43. The death of either of the spouses shall, except in the case in which the judgment of separation may produce the effects referred to in articles 48 to 52 inclusively, extinguish the action of separation, even though such death takes place after the demand.
44. The  existence  of  grounds  on  which  both  spouses  may demand separation shall not operate so as to bar either of them from bringing a suit for separation against the other.
45. Nevertheless, where it appears that the defendant also had grounds on which he or she might have demanded separation, the court may take such grounds into consideration for the purposes of the provisions contained in article 52.
46. During  the  pendency  of  the  action  for  separation,  either spouse, whether plaintiff or defendant, may leave the matrimonial home and may, whether or not he or she has left the matrimonial home demand that the court shall determine who of the spouses if any shall reside in the matrimonial home during the pendency of such action.

48. (1) The  spouse who  shall have given cause to the separation on any of the grounds referred to in articles 38 and 41, shall forfeit -
2. ( a ) the rights established in articles 631, 633, 825, 826 and 827 of this Code;

For the purposes of this paragraph in order to determine whether  an acquest has been made by the industry chiefly of one party,  regard  shall  be  had  to  the  contributions  in  any form  of  both  spouses  in  accordance  with  article  3  of this Code;
5. ( d ) the right to compel, under any circumstances, the other spouse to supply maintenance to him or her in virtue of the obligation arising from marriage.
- (2) The things mentioned in paragraph (b) of sub-article (1) of this article shall revert to the other spouse, and the acquests mentioned in paragraph (c) of the said sub-article shall remain entirely in favour of such spouse, saving any right which the children or other third parties may have acquired thereon prior to t he  registration of the judgment of separation in the Public Registry.

51. Where  separation is granted on any of the grounds mentioned in article 40, it may produce any of the effects mentioned in article 48, if the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, deems it proper to apply the provisions of that article, in whole or in part.
52. It shall also be in the discretion of the court to determine, according to circumstances, whether the provisions of article 48 shall be applied, wholly or in part, in regard to both spouses or to one of them, or whether they shall not be applied at all in regard to either of them, if both spouses shall have been guilty of acts constituting good grounds for separation.
53. The spouse who has obtained separation shall retain every right or benefit which he or she may have acquired from the other spouse, even though such right or benefit may have been granted to him or her on condition of reciprocity, and such reciprocity does not take place.

- (2) The  amount  of  maintenance  referred  to  in  sub-article  (1), and the maintenance due to children in the event of separation, shall be determined having regard to the means of the spouses, their ability to work and their needs, and regard shall also be had to all the other circumstances of the spouses and of the children, including the following:
6. ( a ) the  needs  of  the  children,  after  considering  all  their circumstances;
7. ( b ) any  disability,  as  defined  in  the  Equal  Opportunities (Persons with Disability) Act, whether such disability is physical or mental;
8. ( c ) circumstances of illness which are of such seriousness and gravity as to compromise the ability of the spouses or of the children to maintain themselves;
9. ( d ) whether the ability of the party to whom maintenance is due to have earnings of whatever  nature  was diminished by reason of that party having, during the marriage, taken care of the household, the other party and the upbringing of the children of the marriage;
10. ( e ) every income or benefit which the spouses, or any of them,  receive  according  to  law,  other  than  social assistance  that  is  not  contributory  which  is  paid  to them under the Social Security Act:

Provided  that  for  the  purposes  of  this  paragraph  the disability pension payable in terms of article 27 of the Social Security Act shall be taken into consideration;

- ( f ) the accommodation requirements of the spouses and of the children;
- ( g ) the  amount  which  would  have  been  due  to  each  of  the parties as a benefit, including, but not limited to, a benefit under a pension scheme, which by reason of the separation,  that  party  will  forfeit  the  opportunity  or possibility of acquiring.
- (3) The provisions of article 381(2) of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure shall apply mutatis mutandis provided that the said article shall be construed to mean that, even where no demand is made by a party to whom maintenance is due, either for that party or for the children, for the application of the provisions of that article, the court may apply the said article out of its own motion.
- (4) In  granting  maintenance,  the  court  may  also  provide  for  the manner in which the same may increase from time to time.
- (5) Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Code,  on separation being pronounced, the court may if it deems it appropriate in the circumstances, order the spouse liable to supply maintenance to pay to the other spouse, in lieu of the whole or part of such maintenance, a lump sum, which the court deems sufficient in order to make the spouse to whom maintenance is due financially independent or less dependent of the other spouse, as the case may be.
- (6) For the purposes of sub-article (5), the court shall, among the circumstances, consider the possibility of the person to whom maintenance is due, of receiving training or retraining in a profession, art, trade or other activity or to commence or continue an activity which generates an income, and order the lump sum for that purpose.
- (7) The court may direct, according to circumstances, that the payment of a lump sum referred to in the previous sub-articles of this article, be made by equal or unequal instalments spread over a reasonable period of time.
- (8) The court may also direct that in lieu of all or part of the lump sum referred to in sub-article (5), the spouse liable thereto shall assign to the other spouse property in ownership or in usufruct, use or habitation.
- (9) Where there  is  a  supervening  change  in  the  means  of  the spouse liable to supply maintenance or the needs of the other spouse, the court may, on the demand of either spouse, order that such maintenance be varied or stopped as the case may be. Where however, a lump sum or an assignment of property has been paid or made in total satisfaction of the obligation of a spouse to supply maintenance to the other spouse, all liability of the former to supply maintenance to the latter shall cease. Where instead, the lump sum or assignment of property has been paid or made only in

partial satisfaction of the said obligation, the court shall, when ordering such lump sum payment or assignment of property, determine at the same time the portion of the maintenance satisfied thereby and any supervening change shall in that case be only in respect of the part not so satisfied and in the same proportion thereto.

- 55 . (1) The  court  may,  at  any  time  during  the  cause  for separation, upon the demand of any of the spouses, order the cessation of the community of acquests or of the community of residue under separate administration existing between the spouses.
- (2) The order for the cessation of the community as provided in sub-article (1) shall be given by means of a judgement from which every party shall have a right of appeal, without requiring permission from the court for this purpose.
- (3) The  order of cessation shall have  effect  between  the spouses from the date of the judgement on appeal or, if no appeal is entered, from the date when the time allowed for the appeal lapses, and it shall remain valid even if the cause for separation is discontinued.
- (4) Prior to ordering the cessation of the  community  as provided in this article, the court shall consider whether any of the parties shall suffer a disproportionate prejudice by reason of the cessation of the community before the judgement of separation.
- (5) The order of cessation under this article shall, at the expense of the party who demanded such cessation, be notified to the Director of Public Registry and it shall have effect as if the cessation of the community of acquests or of the community of residue under separate administration were made by public deed.
- (6) Unless the court, in its discretion, upon the demand of one of the parties, shall have ordered the cessation of the community of acquests or of the community of residue under separate administration existing between the parties at the time of commencement of the cause for separation, on separation being pronounced, the court shall direct that the community of acquests or the community of residue under separate administration shall cease as from the day on which the judgement becomes res judicata.
- (7) The court may however where in its opinion circumstances so warrant direct that an asset or assets comprised in the community be not partitioned before the lapse of such period after the cessation of the community as it may in its direction determine.
- (8) Any direction given by the court in virtue of sub-article (7), may on good cause being shown, be changed or revoked by the court.
- 55A. (1) In pronouncing the judgement of separation, the court shall on the demand of either of the parties, order, according to circumstances:
- ( a ) that any one of the parties shall be entitled to reside in the  matrimonial  home,  to  the  exclusion  of  the  other

party,  for  the  period  and  under  those  conditions  as  it considers appropriate; or

- ( b ) that  the  matrimonial  home  is  to  be  sold,  where  it  is satisfied  that  the  parties  and  their  children  shall  have adequate alternative accommodation,  and that the proceeds of the sale shall be assigned to the parties as it considers appropriate; or
- ( c ) where  the  matrimonial  home  belongs  to  both  parties, to  assign  the  matrimonial  home  to  any  one  of  the parties,  which  party  shall  compensate  the  other  party for the financial loss suffered:

Provided  that,  in  every  case,  the  court  shall  consider  the following:

- ( a ) the  best  interest  of  the  minor  children,  including  the impact that there may be on the minor children if the court were to grant a demand made according to this article;
- ( b ) the welfare of the parties and of the children; and
- ( c ) whether the parties have, or, whether their means and abilities  permit  them  to  have,  another  place  where  to reside.
- (2) The court may, upon a demand of either party, vary a decision taken by it under sub-article (1)( a ), where there is a substantial change in circumstances.
- (3) The provisions of article 3A(2) shall not apply in the case of spouses who are legally separated, unless the contrary is not agreed to between the spouses or is ordered by the court having jurisdiction to pronounce the personal separation; and such agreement or order shall only be effective in regard to third parties as from the date when the deed or order is registered in the Public Registry.
56. (1) On  separation  being  pronounced  the  court  shall  also direct to which of the spouses custody of the children shall be entrusted, the paramount consideration being the welfare of the children.
- (2) It shall be lawful for the court, if it considers such measures to be strictly necessary, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to direct that the children be placed in the custody of persons in loco parentis , of third parties, or in alternative forms of care.
- (3) It shall be lawful for the court to give any such directions in the judgment of separation, although in the action relating thereto no demand has been made respecting the custody of the children.
- (4) The court may, at any time, revoke or vary such directions respecting the children, where the interests of the children so require.
- (5) The  court  may  moreover  where  circumstances  so  require, determine that one or both of the parents shall be deprived wholly or in part of the rights of parental authority.

56A. The Court may, for grave reasons, at any time during the cause for separation, and or, divorce, or when the parties are separated and, or divorced, upon the demand of one of the parties, or of its own motion declare that the other party is not fit to have the custody of the minor children of the parties, and where the Court issues such a declaration, the party so declared, upon the death of the other party, shall not be entitled to assume the custody of the minor children without the authorisation of the Court:

Provided that evidence of domestic violence shall constitute a grave reason for the purposes of this article.

57. (1) Whosoever  may  be  the  person  to  whom  the  minor children are entrusted, the spouses shall maintain their right to watch over their maintenance and education, and shall still be bound to contribute thereto, according to law:

Provided  that  this  right  may  be  suspended  if  the  exercise thereof would put either the children or the other parent at a risk of harm.

- (2) It  shall  be  in  the  discretion  of  the  court,  according  to circumstances, to fix the time, place, and manner in which the spouses shall have access to the children:

Provided  that  the  right  of  access  may  be  withdrawn  by  the Court when the spouse who is granted such right of access fails to exercise such right without reasonable cause.

- (3) It shall be lawful for the court entirely to forbid such access to their minor children if it may be detrimental to the welfare of such minors or to the welfare of anyone of the parents.
58. (1) The court may, where it shall deem it expedient so to do in the interest of the spouses and the children, order the suspension of the action of separation for such time as it may deem proper, and give such interim directions as circumstances may require.
- (2) The decree ordering the suspension of the action, or giving such interim directions, shall be subject to appeal.

- (3) This  decree  shall  have  the  same  effect  of  the  judgment given by the competent court.

- (2) In the case of a consensual separation, a declaration of such choice shall be made in the public deed of separation, and in the case of a judicial separation, by a note filed in the records of the case before final judgment.
- (3)  The  court  may,  at  the  request  of  one  of  the  spouses,  which may be made at any time before judgment, prohibit the other spouse from continuing to use the former's surname after separation, where such use may cause grave prejudice to the spouse requesting the prohibition.
9. 62A.

Provided  that  when  the  demand  is  made  by  one  of  the spouses against the other spouse, on the date of commencement of the divorce proceedings, the spouses shall  have  lived  apart  for  a  period  of,  or  periods  that amount  to,  at  least  one  year  out  of  the  preceding  two years; or

- ( b ) on the date of commencement of the divorce proceedings,  the  spouses  are  separated  by  means  of  a contract or court judgment; and
- ( c ) there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation between the spouses; and
- ( d ) the  spouses  and  all  of  their  children  are  receiving adequate maintenance, where this is due, according to their  particular  circumstances,  as  provided  in  article 57:

Provided that the spouses may, at any time, renounce their right to maintenance:

Provided further that for purposes of this paragraph, maintenance ordered by the court by a judgement of separation or agreed to between the spouses in a contract of separation, shall be deemed to be adequate maintenance:

Provided further that a divorce pronounced between spouses who were separated by a contract or by a judgement shall not bring about any change in what was ordered or agreed to between them, except for the effects of divorce resulting from the law.

- 66C. After  the  court  considers the requirements of article 66B to have been satisfied, the court shall hear and decide on the demands made by the parties as provided in this Sub-Title and it shall proceed to pronounce the divorce of the parties.
- 66D. (1) Without prejudice to the other provisions of this SubTitle, where an application for divorce is made by one of the spouses, it shall not be necessary for the spouse making the demand to impute to the other party any fault leading to the making of such demand.
- (2) Where  the  spouses  are  already  separated  by  means  of  a contract or a court judgement, the spouse making the demand for divorce may only demand the dissolution of the marriage. The other party may contest the demand by proving that the spouse demanding the divorce has not paid maintenance that was due as ordered by the court or agreed to in the separation contract and that, if the demand for divorce were to be accepted, it would be more difficult for the said other party to obtain the payment of maintenance. The court shall not grant the demand for divorce where any of the said defences are shown to be valid.

- (3) Where the spouses are not separated by means of a contract or a court judgement, the spouse making the demand for divorce may, together with the same demand, make all those demands that are permissible in a cause for separation in accordance with SubTitle III of this Title.

When such a claim is made, the court shall hear the parties in order to verify that the conditions stipulated in article 66B for the filing of a demand for divorce are satisfied. The court shall decide upon the said claim in a judgement given in open court which shall not be subject to appeal except together with the final judgement.

## Sub-title I

## OF THE FILIATION OF CHILDREN CONCEIVED OR BORN IN WEDLOCK

67. A child conceived in wedlock is held to be the child of the spouses.
68. A child born not before one hundred and eighty days from the celebration of the marriage, nor after three hundred days from the dissolution or annulment of the marriage, shall be deemed to have been conceived in wedlock.
69. The spouse who has not given birth cannot repudiate a child born before the lapse of one hundred and eighty days after the marriage in any of the following cases:
4. ( a ) if,  before the marriage, such spouse was aware of the pregnancy;

6. ( c ) if the child be declared not viable.
70. (1) Any spouse, except for the spouse who gave birth to the child, may bring an action to repudiate a child born in wedlock:
8. ( a ) if  such  spouse  proves  that  during  the  time  from  the three  hundredth  day  to  the  one-hundred-and-eightieth day before the birth  of  the  child,  such  spouse  was  in the physical impossibility of cohabiting with the spouse who gave birth on account of being away from the said spouse, or some other accident; or
9. ( b ) if  such  spouse  proves  that  during  the  said  time  such spouse  was de  facto or  legally  separated  from  the spouse who gave birth:
10. Provided that such spouse may not repudiate the child if  there  has  been, during that time, a reunion, even if temporary between the spouses; or
11. ( c ) if  such  spouse  proves  that  during  the  said  time  such spouse was  afflicted by impotency, even if  such impotency was only an impotency to generate; or
12. ( d ) if  such  spouse  proves  that  during  the  said  time  the

spouse who gave birth had committed adultery or that, that spouse had concealed the pregnancy and the birth of the child; or

- ( e ) if  such  spouse  produces  evidence  of  any  other  fact which may also be genetic and scientific tests and data that tends to exclude such parenthood.

- (5) The Civil Court (Family Section) shall dismiss the application if and as long as the clarification of the natural parentage would result in a considerable adverse effect on the best interests of the minor child, which would be unreasonable for the child, even taking into account the concerns of the person entitled to bring the action.

- ( d ) the  alleged  natural  parent  may  require  both  spouses and the child,

to consent to a genetic test of parentage and to acquiesce to the taking  of  a  genetic  sample  appropriate  for  the  test,  which sample  must  then  be  taken  according  to  the  then  current provisions of the law.

- (2) On the application, mentioned in sub-article (1), of a person entitled to clarify, the Civil Court (Family Section) may require any of the spouses, the child, and the alleged natural parent, as appropriate, to consent to a genetic test of parentage, and to acquiesce to the taking of a genetic sample appropriate for the test, which sample must be taken according to the current provisions of the law:

Provided  that  where  the  said  consent  is  not  given  by  the parties, the Civil Court (Family Section) must substitute that consent that has not been given and order acquiescence in the taking of a sample.

- (3) In the absence of genetic and scientific evidence, the Civil Court (Family Section) may consider any other evidence presented which it deems to be relevant, including the drawing of inferences from the fact that a person did not provide a genetic sample, despite being ordered to do so.
- (4) The  Civil Court (Family Section) shall dismiss the application if and as long as the clarification of the natural parentage would result in a considerable adverse effect on the best interests of the minor child, which would be unreasonable for the child, even taking into account the concerns of the person entitled to bring the action.
- (5) A person who has consented to a genetic test of parentage and has given a genetic sample may require the person entitled to bring the action who has had a parentage test made, to permit inspection of the genetic test of parentage report or to provide a copy. The Civil Court (Family Section) shall decide disputes arising from the claim under sub-article (1).
- (6) The  action  mentioned  in  sub-article  (1)  shall  be  decided  by virtue of a decree, which decree may be appealed according to the procedure contemplated in article 229(2) of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.

Provided further that where an action to disown a child is instituted by one of the spouses after the lapse of the  periods  stipulated  in  paragraphs  (a),  (b)  or  (c)  in accordance  with  the  first  proviso  to  this  article,  any judgment whereby the child is disowned shall not have the effect of changing the surname of the child or of any other person who took his surname from the child unless the  court,  upon  the  demand  of  any  of  the  parties  made either  in  the  sworn  application  whereby  the  action  is commenced or in a separate application made during the action, provides otherwise.

74. Where any one of the spouses dies without having brought the action for disavowal, but before the expiration of the time provided in article 73( a ), ( b ) or ( c ), the heirs may bring such action within six months to be reckoned from the day on which the property of the deceased shall have passed into the hands of the child, or from the day on which the heirs shall have been by the child disturbed in the possession of such property.

## Sub-title II

## OF THE PROOF OF FILIATION OF CHILDREN CONCEIVED OR BORN IN WEDLOCK

78. (1) The filiation of children conceived or born in wedlock is proved by the act of birth registered in the Public Registry.
- (2) It may also be proved by the parochial registers.
79. In  default  of  evidence  as  provided  in  the  last  preceding article, the continued possession of the status of a child conceived or born in wedlock shall be sufficient.
80. (1) Such  possession  shall  be  established  by  a  series  of facts which, collectively, go to show the connection of filiation and relationship between an individual and the family to which he claims to belong.
- (2) Such facts are chiefly the following:
6. ( a ) in  the  case  of  spouses  who  have  contracted  marriage before  the  coming  into  force  of  the  Marriage  Act  and other Laws (Amendment) Act, 2017 * that the individual has always borne the surname of the father of whom he claims to be the child;

If the absence has continued for a period of six years since provisional possession has been granted, or if an application made by the testamentary heirs or the heirs-at-law of the absentee before the court of voluntary jurisdiction of the island in which the absentee last resided against curators appointed by the said court such absence has been declared by a decree to have subsisted for a period of ten continuous years from the day the absentee was last heard of, the court of voluntary jurisdiction shall, upon the demand of the parties interested, award a decree, granting absolute possession of the property and the absolute exercise of the rights depending upon the death of the absentee, discharging the securities and directing any other caution which may have been imposed if any, to cease:

Provided  that  if  the  absent  person  is  a  minor,  the  period  of absence established under this article shall run from the day such person would have attained majority.

224. The  provisions  of  the  last  preceding  article,  or,  as  the case may be, the declaration of the opening of the succession may also take place, even though no curator shall have been appointed, nor provisional possession granted as provided in the preceding two sub-titles, in each of the following cases:
2. ( a ) if  one  hundred  years  since  the  birth  of  the  absentee, and at least one year since the last news of him, shall have elapsed;
3. ( b ) if  eighty  years  since  the  birth  of  the  absentee,  and  at least  six  years  since  the  last  news  of  him,  shall  have elapsed.
225. It  shall  be  lawful  for  the  persons  placed  in  absolute possession of the property or allowed the absolute exercise of the rights depending upon the death of the absentee, to proceed to final partitions of the property, and to dispose freely thereof.
226. If the absentee returns, or his existence is established, he shall recover his property in the state in which it may be, and shall be entitled to the price of such property as has been disposed of, if such price is still due, or to the property in which such price may have been invested.
227. The children or descendants of the absentee may, likewise, within the time prescribed in article 845, to be reckoned from the grant of absolute possession or from the day on which the declaration of the opening of the succession may have been obtained, enforce their rights on the property of the absentee according to the rules laid down in the last preceding article, without being bound to prove his death.
228. If  after  the  grant  of  absolute  possession,  the  time  of  the death of the absentee is established, such persons as, at that time, were his heirs or legatees, or were vested with any right in consequence of the death, or their successors, may bring the actions competent to them, saving the rights which the possessors may have acquired by prescription, and the effects of good faith in regard to the fruits already collected.

## OF THE EFFECTS OF ABSENCE IN REGARD TO EVENTUAL RIGHTS OF THE ABSENTEE

229. No  person  may  claim  any  right  on  behalf  of  any  other person who is not known to be living, unless he proves that such other person was alive at the time when such right originated.
230. (1) Upon the opening of a succession to which a person who is not known to be living is entitled, wholly or in part, such succession shall devolve upon those with whom such person would have a right to compete, or upon those who would have taken it in his default, saving the right of representation.
- (2) Those upon whom, in default of such person, the succession devolves, shall proceed to make up an inventory, or, if the court deems it more expedient, a description of the property.
231. The  provisions  of  the  last  two  preceding  articles  shall apply, without prejudice to the right to maintain an action to obtain an inheritance, or to the other rights competent to the absentee, or his representatives, or other persons claiming under him. Such rights shall only be extinguished by the lapse of the time required for prescription.
232. So  long  as  the  absentee  does  not  appear,  or  no  actions competent to him are brought in his behalf, those upon whom the succession has devolved shall not be bound to return such fruits as may have been collected by them in good faith.

351. (1) The inventory shall be made up in the presence of the owner, or after his having been called upon to attend even by means of a judicial letter.

- (3) Unless otherwise provided in the act creating the usufruct, the expenses of the inventory shall be borne by the usufructuary.
352. (1) It  shall  likewise  be  unlawful  for  the  usufructuary, unless he has been exempted by the act creating the usufruct, to commence to exercise his rights over the things subject to the usufruct before he has given security that he will enjoy the things so subject as a bonus paterfamilias , that he will restore the movables, refund the values of the things mentioned in article 329, and make good any damage that might happen through his negligence whether to the movables or to the immovables.

358. If  the  usufructuary  declares  on  oath  that  he  has  been unable to find security, the court may order that an urban tenement and the necessary furniture for the habitation and the personal use of himself and his family be delivered to him, without security, subject to the obligation of restoring them at the termination of the usufruct.

365. (1) No  action  shall  lie  in  favour  of  the  usufructuary  to compel the owner to carry out the repairs which are at his charge; but, if the owner refuses to carry out such repairs, it shall be lawful for the usufructuary to demand that he be authorized by the court to effect such repairs, and to recover from the owner, at the termination of the usufruct, the amount of the expenses incurred, without interest, provided the utility of the repairs subsists at the time of the termination of the usufruct:

Provided the usufructuary shall be entitled to recover only the value of such repairs as determined by means of a valuation, regard being had to the time of the demand, if he fails to give to the owner an account of the expenses incurred by him together with the respective vouchers within six months from the day on which the repairs shall have been completed.

- (2) The account shall be considered as accepted by the owner, if he shall not, within two months, declare his intention to contest it.

- (2) For  determining  whether  the  part  which  has  fallen  off  the building which constitutes the principal subject of the usufruct, is an accessory part, regard shall be had not only to the destination of such part, but also to the expense required for reconstructing such part as against the expense which would be required for the reconstruction of the whole building.
368. The usufructuary cannot prevent the owner from carrying out, in the manner least inconvenient to the usufructuary, the repairs and works referred to in the last three preceding articles.

- (3) If the usufructuary is not willing to make such advance, the owner may effect the payment either with his own money, in which case the usufructuary shall pay to him interest thereon during the continuance of the usufruct, or by causing a portion of the property subject to the usufruct to be sold, to the extent of the sum due.
373. (1) The costs of lawsuits relating to the usufruct exclusively shall be borne by the usufructuary.
- (2) The costs of lawsuits relating to the ownership exclusively are at the charge of the owner.

378. Usufruct terminates -
2. ( a ) by the death of the usufructuary;
3. ( b ) by the expiration of the time for which it  was constituted;

5. ( d ) by non-user of the right during thirty years;
6. ( e ) by the total loss of the subject of the usufruct.
379. (1) Usufruct may also terminate by reason of the wrongful use which the usufructuary makes of his right, either by causing injury to the tenements, or by suffering them to run into ruin for want of ordinary repairs.
- (2) In any such case the court may, according to the gravity of the circumstances, instead of ordering the absolute termination of the usufruct, either appoint an administrator, or order that the property be returned to the owner, subject to the condition, however, of paying annually to the usufructuary, or to those claiming under him, a fixed sum during the continuance of the usufruct.
- (3) The  usufructuary,  as  well  as  any  of  his  creditors,  may prevent the termination of the usufruct, the appointment of an administrator, or the return of the property as aforesaid, by offering to carry out the necessary repairs, and by giving security for the performance of this obligation within a time to be fixed by the court, provided the offer be made and the security given before judgment is delivered on the demand of the owner, or within fifteen days from the day on which the judgment has become a res judicata.

- (2) When a right of usufruct is settled under trusts in favour of

- a trustee, including a corporate trustee, or is endowed to a private foundation for the benefit of beneficiaries who are natural persons, for the purposes of this article, the usufruct shall be considered as being constituted in favour of the beneficiaries who are named and who have a right to enjoy the property and, unless expressly stated otherwise, shall operate for the lifetime of such beneficiaries.
381. Where  the  usufruct  is  granted  until  a  third  party  shall attain a given age, it shall last for all that time, even if the third party dies before attaining that age.
382. Where the usufruct is constituted in favour of two or more persons conjointly, in terms of articles 738 and 739, it shall only terminate at the death of the person last surviving, and the portion of any predeceased person shall by accretion vest in the persons surviving.
383. The  sale  of  the  thing  subject  to  the  usufruct  shall  not operate so as to alter in any way the right of the usufructuary; and he shall continue in the enjoyment of his usufruct, unless he shall have waived his right thereto.

386. (1) Where the only subject of the usufruct is a building, and such building falls down through age or is destroyed by a fortuitous event, the usufructuary shall not be entitled to enjoy either the soil or the materials.
- (2) Where,  however, the usufruct was constituted over a tenement of which such building was only a part, the usufructuary shall be entitled to enjoy the soil, and he may use the materials either in the reconstruction of the fallen building or in the repair of other parts of the tenement subject to the usufruct.
- (3) In  each  of  the  aforesaid  cases,  if  the  building  is  not destroyed, or does not fall down except in part, the usufructuary shall retain the right to enjoy the soil and the materials.
387. Where the subject of the usufruct is a ship, and the ship is in such condition as to be beyond repair, the usufruct terminates.
388. The usufruct of an annuity or of a debt does not terminate on the repayment of the capital; the usufructuary may re-invest such capital or, as the case may be, demand that it be re-invested to his profit.

or until a third party reaches a given age, or in favour of two or more persons conjointly.

The rights of use and habitation may not be created by the owner otherwise than by a public deed, and they shall not be operative as against third parties before the deed is registered in the Public Registry, upon the demand of any of the interested parties, or of the notary before whom the deed was executed. The note for the registration of the deed shall be drawn up as provided in subarticle (2) of article 330.
391. Where the extent of the right of use or of habitation is not fixed in the deed creating such right, the rules laid down in the following articles shall apply.

393. Habitation  is  the  real  right  of  a  person  to  live  with  his family and according to his condition in a house belonging to another.
394. For  the  purposes  of  the  last  two  preceding  articles,  the word "family" shall also include the children born since the commencement of the right of use or habitation, even though the grantee was not married at the time of the commencement of such right, as well as acknowledged illegitimate children, adopted children and servants.

4. ( c ) for  carrying  out  such  works  as  may  be  necessary  for the support of the additional weight resulting from the raising of the wall, so that the stability of the wall will not be impaired.
415. Where the common wall is not in a condition to sustain the additional height, the person desiring to raise its height must have it entirely reconstructed at his expense, and the additional thickness must be taken on his own side.
416. In each of the cases mentioned in the last two preceding articles, the party raising the height of the wall is moreover bound to make good to his neighbour any damage which the latter may s u f f e r   i n   c o n s e q u e n c e   o f   t h e   r a i s i n g   o f   t h e   w a l l   o r   t h e reconstruction.
417. The neighbour who has not contributed to the raising of the height of a common wall may acquire co-ownership of the additional height by paying one-half of the cost thereof and the value of half the land used for the additional thickness, if any.
418. (1) Every owner may also make common, in whole or in part, a wall contiguous to his tenement by reimbursing to the owner of the wall one-half of its total value, or one-half of the value of that portion which he desires to make common, and one-half of the value of the land on which the wall is built, and by carrying out such works as may be necessary to avoid causing damage to his neighbour.
- (2) The provisions of this article shall not apply in the case of buildings destined for public use.

13. ( c ) to deposit manure or other corrosive or damp substance in such a manner as to be in contact with the common wall;
14. ( d ) to  heap  earth  or  other  matter  against  a  common  wall without  taking  the  necessary  precautions  in  order  to prevent  such  heaps  from  causing,  by  pressure or otherwise, damage to the other neighbour.

420. Any person may compel his neighbour to contribute to the construction or repair of walls separating courtyards, gardens, or fields, up to the height specified in article 408, regard being had to the nature and level of the tenement of the defendant.
421.

422. Saving the provisions of article 418, where, in  the  cases referred to in the last two preceding articles, a neighbour is unwilling to contribute to the expense of construction or repair of the wall, he may release himself therefrom by giving up his half of the land on which the party-wall is to be built, and waiving his right of co-ownership of such wall.
423. Where  the  several  storeys  or  other  parts  of  a  building belong to different owners, the contribution of each of the owners to the expense of the repairs or reconstruction which may be required shall be in proportion to the benefit which the respective part of the building derives from such repairs or reconstruction.
424. Where  a  common  wall  or  a  house  is  reconstructed,  any active or passive easement shall be maintained also with regard to the new wall or house, provided such easement is not rendered more burdensome, and such reconstruction is made before prescription has been acquired.
425. It shall not be lawful for one of the neighbours without the consent of the other to make in the party-wall any window or other opening.

430. Where the earth excavated for the formation of the ditch, or the refuse accumulated therein for a period of three years, is only on one side of the ditch, this shall be an indication that the ditch is not common, and the ditch is presumed to be the exclusive property of the party on the side of whose tenement the earth or the accumulated refuse is found.
431. Where the ditch serves for the drainage of the lands of one owner only, this shall be an indication that the ditch is not common.

## 432. A common ditch shall be kept in repair at joint expense:

Provided that it shall be lawful for any co-owner to relieve himself of such obligation by waiving his right of co-ownership.

433. The  trees  which  are  on  the  boundary-line  between  two tenements shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to be common; and each of the neighbours may demand that such trees be uprooted or cut if he proves that the damage they may cause to his tenement is greater than the benefit he himself may derive therefrom.

## § III. OF DISTANCES REQUIRED IN CERTAIN CASES

434. Every person  may  construct  any  wall  or  building  on  the boundary-line of his tenement, saving the right of the neighbour to acquire co-ownership of the wall as provided in article 418.
435. (1) Even  where  the  construction  is  not  made  on  the boundary-line, the neighbour may, if a distance of at least one and one-half metres has not been left, demand co-ownership of the wall, and may build up to, and against such wall, on paying, besides the value of half the wall, the value of the ground which he would thus occupy, unless the owner of the ground prefers to extend his building, at the same time, up to the boundary-line.
- (2) If  the  neighbour  does  not  wish  to  avail  himself  of  such power, he must construct his wall or building in such a manner that there shall be a distance of three metres from the wall or building of the other party.
- (3) The same rule shall be observed in any other case where the construction of the other party is at a distance of less than three metres from the boundary.
- (4) The mere raising of the height of a house or wall already existing is deemed to be a new construction.
436. The provisions of the last two preceding articles shall not apply in the case of buildings destined for public use, or of walls bordering on public squares or streets.

437. (1) It  shall  not  be  lawful  for  any  person  to  plant  in  his own tenement tall-stemmed trees at a distance of less than two metres and forty centimetres, or other trees at a distance of less than one metre and twenty centimetres from the boundary between his tenement and that of his neighbour.

- (3) The neighbour may, unless the period required for prescription has elapsed, demand that trees planted at a lesser distance, or which, notwithstanding the observance of the aforesaid distance, are causing him damage, be uprooted at the expense of the owner.
- (4) The court, however, may grant to the owner of such trees the option either to uproot them, or to cause ditches or other works to be made at his expense sufficient to prevent all damage to the tenement of his neighbour.
- (5) The provisions of this article shall not apply in cases where the adjoining tenements are separated by a wall, provided the aforesaid trees, shrubs or plants are so kept as not to exceed the height of the wall.
438. (1) A person  over  whose  tenement  the  branches  of  the neighbour's trees extend, may compel him to cut such branches, and may gather the fruits hanging from them.

440. (1) Notwithstanding the observance of the distance prescribed in the last preceding article, whosoever makes any excavation, shall be bound to make good any damage caused by such excavation to his neighbour's building, provided such building has been constructed according to the usages and the rules of art prevailing at the time of its construction.
- (2) Nevertheless,  no  liability  for  damages  is  incurred,  if  the excavation is made at the distance which the court, upon the demand of the party wishing to make the excavation, shall have fixed, according to circumstances, or if such party has executed such works as, according to circumstances, shall have been ordered by the court so as to avoid causing any damage to the neighbour.
441. (1) Any sink-pipe or any pipe for water dripping from the roofs, or for water raised by means of a pump or other mechanical device, shall be at a distance of at least one metre from the boundary, to be measured from the nearest point of the external part of such pipe.

- (2) The observance of such distance is not required if the pipes used are such as do not allow any dampness to penetrate into the wall, or if other means are used fit to prevent the passage of any such dampness.
- (3) Nevertheless,  if,  notwithstanding  the  observance  of  the distance prescribed under sub-article (1) of this article, or the use of such pipes or means as are mentioned in sub-article (2) of this article, damage is caused to the neighbour, the owner of the pipes shall be bound to make, at his own expense, any other work that may be necessary for preventing the continuance of the damage, and, if necessary, even to remove the pipes to a greater distance.
442. (1) Where  a  cistern  extends  under  the  tenement  of  the neighbour, such neighbour may bore a hole and make use of the water, subject to his obligation to refund to the owner of the tenement in which the excavation of the cistern was commenced one-half of the expense incurred.
- (2) Each of the two neighbours may demand that the part of the cistern which exists under his tenement be separated from that existing under the other tenement by means of a wall to be constructed and, when necessary, repaired at joint expense.
- (3) Where, however, the part of the cistern existing under the tenement of one of the neighbours is considerably larger than the part existing under the tenement of the other, the court may, according to circumstances, in ordering the separation, direct the former to refund to the latter a proportionate part of the sum which he may have paid for the excavation of the cistern.
443. (1) It shall not be lawful for the owner of any building to open windows at a distance of less than seventy-six centimetres from the party-wall.
- (2) In  the  case  of  balconies  or  other  similar  projections,  the distance prescribed under sub-article (1) of this article shall be measured from the external line of that side of the balcony or other projection, which is nearer to the party-wall, to the internal line of such wall.
444. (1) It shall not be lawful for any person to construct any oven except at a distance of at least thirty centimetres from the party-wall, and with a passage for air between the wall and the oven.
- (2) Kitchen-stoves  shall  be  at  a  distance  of  at  least  fifteen centimetres from the party-wall.

447. (1) Any owner whose tenement has no outlet to the public road, may compel the owners of the neighbouring tenements to allow him the necessary way, subject to the payment of an indemnity proportionate to the damage which such way may cause.
- (2) Such right of way shall be exercised over that part where it will be least injurious to the person over whose tenement it is allowed.
448. Where the tenement has become enclosed on all sides in consequence of a sale, exchange, or partition, the vendors, the parties to the exchange, or the co-partitioners are bound to grant a foot-way, horse-way or cart-way, as the case may be, without any indemnity.
449. Where  the  right  of  way  granted  as  aforesaid  shall,  in consequence of the opening of a new road, or of the incorporation of the tenement with another tenement contiguous to the public road, cease to be necessary, the owner of the servient tenement may demand the discontinuance of such right of way on restitution of the indemnity received or the cessation of the annual payment agreed upon.
450. (1) Any  person  who  cannot  receive  water  into  his  own tenement from fountains or other deposits of public water, except through rural tenements belonging to other persons, may compel the owners of such tenements to grant him, in such manner as shall least injuriously affect them, the right of watercourse, subject to the payment of an indemnity proportionate to the damage.
- (2) It  shall  not  be  lawful  for  such  person  to  compel  the  said owners to allow him to make new channels, if they grant to him watercourse by means of the existing channels; in which case the indemnity shall be determined having regard to the value of such channels, and the expense necessary for their first repair, and the person who makes use of them shall remain bound to contribute to the expense of their upkeep as provided in article 452.
451. The action for the payment of the indemnity under articles 447 and 450 is subject to prescription: and the right of way or of watercourse may continue to be exercised, although the action for the payment of the indemnity can no longer be maintained.
452. Any person who is  entitled  to  make  use  of  the  channels made for the passage of water is bound to contribute to the expenses for their necessary repairs, saving his right to relief, where competent, against the persons through whose fault the channels have been damaged.

## Sub-title II

## OF EASEMENTS CREATED BY THE ACT OF MAN

## § I. OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF EASEMENTS WHICH CAN BE CREATED BY THE ACT OF MAN, AND OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SUCH EASEMENTS ARE CREATED

454. It  shall  be  lawful  for  owners  to  establish,  in  accordance with article 400, any easement which is in no way contrary to public policy.
455. (1) Easements are continuous or discontinuous, apparent or non-apparent.
- (2) Continuous easements are those the enjoyment of which is or may be continuous without the necessity of any actual i n t e r f e r e n c e   b y   m a n :   s u c h   a s   t h e   e a s e m e n t   o f   w a t e r c o u r s e , eavesdrop, prospect and others of a like nature.
- (3) Discontinuous easements are those the enjoyment of which can only be had by the actual interference of man: such as the easement of right of way, of drawing water, and others of a like nature.
- (4) Apparent  easements  are those the existence  of  which appears from visible signs: such as a door, a window, or an artificial watercourse.
- (5) Non-apparent  easements  are  those  which  have  no  visible signs of their existence: such as the prohibition to build on a certain land or to build above a specified height.
456. (1) Easements are, moreover, affirmative or negative.
- (2) Affirmative easements are those which consist in the right of making use of the servient tenement.
- (3) Negative easements are those which consist in the right of restraining the owner of the servient tenement from the free use thereof.

457. Continuous and apparent easements may be created -
2. ( a ) by virtue of a title;
3. ( b ) by  prescription,  if  the  tenement  over  which  such easements are exercised may be acquired by prescription;
4. ( c ) by the disposition of the owner of two tenements.
458. The title creating an easement is null unless it results from a public deed; and where the easement is created by a deed inter vivos , the easement shall not be operative as regards third parties before the deed is registered in the Public Registry as provided in article 330, on the demand of any of the parties interested, or of the notary receiving the deed.
459. (1) The owner of a tenement may, without the consent of the usufructuary, establish any easement over the tenement, provided the right of usufruct is not in any way prejudiced thereby.
- (2) With  the  consent  of  the  usufructuary,  the  owner  may establish even an easement diminishing the right of usufruct.
460. (1) An easement granted by one of the co-owners of an undivided tenement, shall not be deemed to be established until the other co-owners shall have also, jointly or separately, granted it.
- (2) Any grant made under any title  whatsoever  by  one  of  the co-owners remains in abeyance until a like grant is made by all the others.
- (3) Nevertheless, any grant made by a co-owner, independently of the other co-owners, shall operate so as to restrain not only the grantor but also his successors, even if singular, or any person claiming under him, from obstructing the exercise of the right so granted.
461. An  easement  granted  by  one  of  the  co-owners  over  an undivided tenement, shall be deemed to be fully established as soon as the grantor becomes the sole owner of the tenement.
462. (1) In  order  to  acquire  an  easement  by  prescription, possession for a period of not less than thirty years is necessary.
- (2) If the servient tenement is subject to entail, or belongs to a church or any other pious institution, the prescriptive period is forty years.
- (3) In the cases referred to in this article, the person pleading prescription is not bound to produce a title, and no plea on the ground of bad faith can be set up against him.
463. (1) In  the  case  of  affirmative  easements,  possession  to found prescription commences from the day on which the owner of the dominant tenement has commenced to exercise the right of easement.
- (2) In  the  case  of  negative  easements,  possession  commences from the day on which the owner of the dominant tenement, shall have, by means of a judicial letter, protest, or other judicial act,

restrained the owner of the servient tenement from the free use thereof.

464. Where the easement is in respect of a flow of water issuing from a tenement belonging to others, or from a spring existing in such tenement, and consists in the right of preventing the diversion of the water, any visible and permanent works which the owner of the dominant tenement may have made in the servient tenement in order to collect the water, or to facilitate its flow in his own tenement, shall be equivalent to the restraint mentioned in the last preceding article.
465. Any  easement  which  the  emphyteuta,  usufructuary  or tenant suffers to be exercised over the tenement, without any preexisting title, shall not prejudice the dominus or the owner of such tenement, notwithstanding any length of time during which the easement may have been exercised.
466. The owner of a tenement subject, in virtue of an easement constituted without title, to receive the rain-water falling on the roofs of a neighbouring building, may, at any time, on payment of an indemnity, compel the owner of such building to cause such easement to cease.
467. The owner of a building in which there is no cistern, who, in virtue of an easement constituted without title, is obliged to allow the rain-water falling on the roofs of that building to flow to a neighbouring tenement, may, at any time, on payment of an indemnity, cause such easement to cease if he has constructed in such building a cistern for the collection of such rain-water.
468. An easement is created by "the disposition of the owner of two tenements" if it is proved that the two tenements, now divided, belonged to the same owner, and it was such owner who placed or left things in the state which gives rise to the easement.
469. (1) Continuous  non-apparent  easements,  and  discontinuous easements, whether apparent or non-apparent, can only be created by a title; they cannot be created by prescription or by the disposition of the owner of two tenements.
- (2) Nevertheless, the easement of right of way for the use of a tenement may be acquired by the prescription of thirty years, if such tenement has no other outlet to the public road; and any other easement which, on the 11th February, 1870, was already acquired under previous laws, may not be impeached.

## § II. OF THE MANNER IN WHICH EASEMENTS ARE EXERCISED

470. The creation of an easement shall be deemed to include the granting of all that is necessary for the enjoyment of such easement with the least possible damage to the servient tenement. Thus the

right of drawing water carries with it the right of way, and the right to cause water to be led over another person's tenement includes the right of way along the sides of the channel in order to watch over the flow of the water, and to clean the channel and make the necessary repairs.

471. Any person to whom an easement is competent may carry out at his expense and in such manner as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the owner of the servient tenement, the works that are necessary for the exercise and preservation of the easement.
472. Where the owner of the servient tenement is bound, in the terms of the title, to bear the expense necessary for the exercise or preservation of the easement, such obligation shall remain attached to that tenement, even though it passes into other hands:

Provided that the possessor of such tenement may release himself from such obligation by abandoning, in favour of the owner of the dominant tenement, that part of the servient tenement over which the easement is exercised.

473. If  a  severance  of  the  dominant  tenement takes  place, the easement which attached to the tenement will continue to attach to the several portions, without, however, increasing the burden on the servient tenement. Thus, where the easement is that of right of way, the owners of all the portions of the tenement so divided shall make use of the same path.
474. (1) The owner of the servient tenement cannot do anything which tends to diminish the exercise of the easement or to make such exercise more inconvenient. He may not alter the condition of the tenement, nor may he assign for the exercise of the easement any part of the tenement other than that over which it was originally established.
- (2) Nevertheless, if the exercise of the easement in or over the part originally assigned has become more burdensome to the owner of the servient tenement, or if such owner is thereby prevented from carrying out works, repairs, or improvements in his tenement, he may offer to the owner of the dominant tenement a part equally convenient for the exercise of the easement, and the latter may not refuse it.
- (3) The  part  of  the  tenement  assigned  for  the  exercise  of  the easement may likewise be changed upon the demand of the owner of the dominant tenement, if he proves that such change will be of considerable advantage to him, and will cause no damage whatsoever to the servient tenement.
475. Any person having a right of easement shall exercise such right in the terms of his title, and it shall not be lawful for such person to make either in the servient or in the dominant tenement, any alteration which may increase the burden on the servient tenement.
476. In  case  of  doubt  as  to  the  extent  of  an  easement,  its exercise shall be restricted to what is necessary, having regard to

Right to carry out works necessary for enjoyment and preservation of easement.

When owner of servient tenement is bound to carry out repairs.

Where dominant tenement is divided.

Owner of servient tenement cannot do anything injurious to easement.

Owner of dominant tenement may not render easement more burdensome.

Doubt as to extent of easement.

Duty of person granting water from a spring or channel.

Owner of tenement subject to easement in respect of flow of water may freely use such water.

Easements are extinguished when they can no longer be exercised, by merger or unity of possession,

by non-user. Amended by: L.N. 148 of 1975.

Running of periods of non-user.

Prescription in favour of third party in possession.

the destination of the dominant tenement at the time the easement was created and to the convenient use of such tenement, with the least damage to the servient tenement.

477. In the absence of an agreement, the owner or other person making a grant of water from a spring or a channel is bound, towards those who, under such grant, are entitled to make use of such water, to carry out the works required to lead the water from its source to the place from which the water is to be taken.
478. The  easement  in  respect  of  a  flow  of  water,  does  not deprive the owner of the servient tenement of his right of freely using such water to his advantage.

## § III. OF THE MANNER IN WHICH EASEMENTS ARE EXTINGUISHED

479. (1) An easement is extinguished when the things subject thereto are in such a condition that it can no longer be exercised.
- (2) Nevertheless,  the  easement  will  revive  if  the  things  are restored in such a manner that it can be again exercised, unless a period of time sufficient to raise a presumption of the extinguishment of the easement under article 481 shall have elapsed.
480. (1) An easement is extinguished where the dominant and the servient tenements become united in the ownership of one person.
- (2) Where, however, a visible sign of an easement exists, and the owner disposes of one of the said tenements without there being in the contract any declaration as to the easement, such easement shall continue to be operative, actively or passively, in favour of, or over, the tenement so alienated.
481. (1) An  easement  is  extinguished  by  non-user  for  the period of forty years, in the case of property belonging to the Government of Malta or to a church or other pious institution, and of thirty years, in the case of any other property.
- (2) The  provisions  of  this  article  shall  not  apply  where  the non-user was due to the conditions referred to in article 479 provided the owner of the dominant tenement could not, according to law, cause such conditions to cease.
482. The periods of non-user referred to in the last preceding article, shall begin to run, according to the different kinds of easements, either from the date of the last exercise thereof, if the easement is discontinuous, or from the date of the first act done in contravention thereof, if the easement is continuous.
483. In  regard  to  a  third  party  in  possession  of  the  servient tenement, the easement shall be extinguished by the lapse of the time required for the prescription of the ownership of the tenement itself according to the provisions relating to prescription under

Title XXV of Part II of Book Second of this Code.

484. The manner of enjoying an easement may be prescribed as the easement itself.
2. 485 . Where  the  dominant  tenement  belongs  to  two  or  more persons in common, the use of the easement made by any one of the co-owners shall operate so as to bar prescription with regard to all the co-owners.
486. (1) Where  among  the  co-owners  there  is  one  against whom prescription could not run, such fact shall operate so as to preserve the right of all the others.

- (3) The  action  for  demanding  a  supplement  in  money  under sub-article (1) of this article shall be barred by the lapse of two years from the date of the partition or other act terminating the community, and the provisions of sub-article (2) of article 1407 shall apply in respect of the running of such period of limitation.
- (4) The  mere  omission  from  a  partition  of  a  thing  held  in community shall only give rise to a supplementary partition.

(1) In relation to a possessor in bad faith, the owner has, in respect of necessary expenses, and of useful expenses for meliorations which cannot be removed, the same obligations as an owner has in relation to a possessor in good faith, provided possession of the thing shall not have been obtained by theft or some other offence which does not fall under the class of contraventions.
- (2) As regards useful expenses for meliorations which can be removed, the owner may elect either to retain such meliorations or to compel the possessor to remove them.
- (3) If the owner demands the removal of such meliorations, the possessor shall remove them at his expense without any right to indemnity, and he shall be bound to make good to the owner any damage which the latter may have suffered.
- (4) If the owner elects to retain the meliorations, he shall, at his option, either refund to the possessor the cost thereof or pay to him a sum corresponding to the enhanced value of the thing.
544. With regard to decorative expenses the possessor, whether in good or bad faith, shall only be entitled to take back the adornments in kind, provided this be advantageous to the possessor

and not injurious to the thing, unless the owner desires to retain such adornments, and pay to the possessor a sum corresponding to the profit that the latter might make by taking them away.

545. (1) Necessary expenses are those without which the thing would have perished or deteriorated.
- (2) Useful  expenses  are  those  which  ameliorate  the  thing  by making it more convenient, or capable of yielding more fruit, but the omission of which is not prejudicial to the thing.
- (3) Decorative  expenses  are  those  which  serve  only  to  adorn the thing, without rendering it more convenient or capable of yielding more fruit, and which if omitted would not cause the thing to deteriorate.
- (4) Decorative  expenses  may,  however,  in  certain  cases,  be considered as useful expenses, regard being had to the condition of the owner, or to the existence of particular circumstances which may afford the owner an immediate opportunity of deriving profit from such expenses.
546. Any  person  who  shall  have  obtained  possession  of  the thing by theft or any other offence, not being a mere contravention, shall not be entitled to any indemnity for any kind of expenses, or to remove any meliorations made on the thing; and he may be compelled by the owner to remove at his expense, and without any right to indemnity, such objects as may be removed, and also to make good any damage which the owner may have suffered.
547. The set-off of the fruits against the expenses mentioned in the foregoing articles shall take place even with regard to the possessor in good faith:

Provided such possessor shall, besides the fruits which he is bound to restore according to the provisions of article 540, be bound to bring into account only the fruits which he shall have collected during the five years preceding the judicial demand of the owner.

548. The possessor, whether in good or bad faith, shall not be bound to restore, or to bring into account for the purposes of the set-off mentioned in the last preceding article, the fruits of any meliorations which, under the provisions of the foregoing articles, he has the right to remove, or for which he is to be indemnified by the owner, unless the owner agrees to pay to him interest on the cost of such meliorations.
549. (1) The expenses for the production or preservation of the fruits of a thing are not comprised in those referred to in the foregoing articles of this sub-title.
- (2) Such  expenses  shall  always  be  deducted  from  the  said fruits.
550. Where  under  the  provisions  of  the  foregoing  articles,  a possessor, whether in good or bad faith, is entitled to recover the expenses made on a thing belonging to others, either by taking back the subject of such expenses, or by the reimbursement of the said

## § II. OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE POSSESSOR WITH REGARD TO THE RESTORATION OF THE THING

551. A  possessor  in  good  faith  is  bound  to  make  good  such damage as, by his own act or otherwise, even before the judicial demand of the owner, may have been caused to the thing, but only to the extent of the benefit which he has derived from such damage.
552. Where the thing possessed is an inheritance or a portion of an inheritance, the possessor, even if in good faith, who has alienated any hereditary thing, is, moreover, bound to restore, but always to the extent of the benefit which he has derived from such alienation, the value of such thing.
553. For  the  purposes  of  the  provisions  of  the  last  two preceding articles, the possessor is deemed to have derived a benefit from the said damage or alienation in each of the following cases only:
4. ( a ) if the subject of the benefit so derived is found, at the time  of  the  judicial  demand,  to  exist  separately  from the things belonging to the possessor;
5. ( b ) if, where the subject of such benefit has been intermixed with things belonging to the possessor, his estate  is  found,  at  the  time  of  such  demand,  to  have been enhanced thereby;
6. ( c ) if, where the subject of such benefit has been consumed  by  the  possessor,  such  possessor  has  in consequence  saved  his  own  things,  and  such  saving still exists:

Provided that it shall be lawful for the possessor in any of the foregoing cases to retain the subject of such benefit on paying to the plaintiff the value of the things at the time he shall have disposed thereof or their value at the time of the demand, whichever is the greater.

554. A  possessor  in  good  faith  is  not,  even  in  the  case  of possession of an inheritance, bound to restore the value of things given, lost or destroyed without profit.
555. The  provisions  of  the  last  three  preceding  articles  shall apply to the possessor of any other universitas rerum .

556. (1) A possessor in bad faith shall in all cases be bound to restore all the things which he has wrongfully occupied.
- (2) Where such possessor has, whether voluntarily or through his own fault, ceased to possess any of such things, he shall be bound to restore to the plaintiff any profit which he may have derived therefrom or, at the option of the plaintiff, to pay to him the value of the thing at the time of the cesser of possession or the value thereof at the time of the demand, whichever is the greater, notwithstanding that, in such case, he shall not have derived any profit therefrom.
557. A possessor in bad faith shall also be liable for all damage which may have been occasioned by his own act as well as for that occasioned by a fortuitous event unless, whatever the manner in which he may have obtained possession of the thing, he shows that the thing would have equally perished or deteriorated if it had been in the possession of the owner.

## § III. OF THE PARTICULAR EFFECTS OF THE POSSESSION OF MOVABLES

558. (1) In  the  case  of  movables  by  nature,  or  securities  to bearer, possession shall produce in favour of third parties in good faith the same effects as the title, saving, in regard to vessels, the provisions of any other law.
- (2) The provisions of this article shall not apply in the case of a universitas of movables.
559. (1) It  shall,  nevertheless,  be  lawful  for  any  person  who has lost a thing, or has been robbed thereof, to recover it on indemnifying the possessor.
- (2) Such  person  may  even  recover  the  thing  without  any obligation to indemnify the possessor if the latter has not obtained the thing in good faith, under an onerous title, from a party who was presumably the owner thereof or a person charged by the owner to dispose of it.

579. Where,  however,  the  workmanship  is  so  valuable  that  it considerably surpasses the value of the materials employed, the workmanship shall be considered as the principal subject, and the artificer shall be entitled to retain the thing so formed on paying to the owner the price of the materials.
580. (1) Where  a  thing  has  been  formed  by  a  mixture  of different materials belonging to different owners, and such materials can be separated without injury, the owner who has not given his assent to the commixture, may demand separation.

Where,  however,  the  materials  belonging  to  one  of  the owners can be considered as the principal subject, or are far superior in value to the other materials, and the different materials cannot be separated, or would, if separated, suffer injury, it shall be lawful for the owner of such materials as are reputed to be the principal subject, or are superior in value, to claim the ownership of the thing created by the commixture, subject to his obligation of paying to the other owner the value of his materials.
582. Where the new subject of property remains in community between the owners of the several materials with which the subject was created, each co-owner may demand the judicial sale thereof by auction for the common benefit and at joint expense.
583. In all cases in which the owner of the materials employed without his concurrence is entitled to claim the ownership of the thing, he may demand, at his option, either that materials of the same quality and quantity be returned to him, or the value thereof.
584. Any person who has made use of materials belonging to others without their consent may also be condemned to pay damages, saving any criminal proceedings to which he may be liable.

- (3) * Where such persons are lawfully released from their vows, they shall again acquire the capacity to receive under a will, as well as to dispose of such property as they may have subsequently acquired, and any disposition made in favour of a person who at the time of the testator's death was a member of a monastic order or of a religious corporation of regulars shall remain suspended until such person is either released from his vows as aforesaid or dies while still a member of such order or corporation, and shall be ineffectual if the person, in whose favour it is made, dies while still such a member.
612. (1) Any  testamentary  disposition  in  favour  of  a  person who is incapable in terms of articles 609 and 610 is void, even if such disposition is made in the name of intermediaries.

615. (1) The reserved portion is the right on the estate of the deceased reserved by law in favour of the descendants and the surviving spouse of the deceased.
- (2) The said right is a credit of the value of the reserved portion against the estate of the deceased. Interest at the rate established in article 1139 shall accrue to such credit from the date of the opening of succession if the reserved portion is claimed within two years from such date, or from the date of service of a judicial act if the claim is made after the expiration of the said period of two years:

Provided that the Court may, if the circumstances of the case so require, decide not to award any interest or establish a rate of interest which is lower than that stipulated in article 1139.

616. (1) The  reserved  portion  due  to  all  children  whether conceived or born in wedlock or conceived and born out of wedlock or adopted shall be one-third of the value of the estate if such children are not more than four in number or one-half of such value if they are five or more.
- (2) The reserved portion is divided in equal shares among the children who participate in it.
- (3) Where there is only one child, he shall receive the whole of the aforesaid third part.
617. For  the  purposes  of  the  last  preceding  article  the  word "children" shall include the descendants of the children in whatsoever degree they may stand. Nevertheless, such descendants shall only be reckoned for the child from whom they descend.
618. (1) Children  or  other  descendants  who  are  incapable  of receiving property by will, or who have been disinherited by the testator, or have renounced their share, shall also be taken into account in determining the number of children for the purpose of regulating the reserved portion.
- (2) Saving the provisions of articles 608 and 626 the portions of the children or other descendants who are incapable, or who have been disinherited, or have renounced their share, shall devolve in favour of the other children or descendants taking the reserved portion.
- (3) A  child  or  other  descendant  who  has  been  instituted  heir, who had he not been so instituted would have been entitled to share t he  reserved portion, shall also be entitled to share therein notwithstanding that he was so instituted.

- (4) The  person  to  whom  the  reserved  portion  is  due  shall impute to it all such things as he may have received from the testator and as are subject to collation under any of the provisions of articles 913 to 938.
- (5) The  person  claiming  the  reserved  portion  shall  take  into account his share any property bequeathed to him by will and cannot renounce any testamentary disposition in his favour and claim the reserved portion, except when such testamentary disposition is made in usufruct or consists in the right of use or habitation, or consists of a life annuity or an annuity for a limited time.
621. (1) Where the subject of the testamentary disposition is a right of usufruct or a life annuity, and it appears to the persons entitled to the reserved portion that the value of such usufruct or life-rent surpasses the disposable portion of the estate of the testator, they shall only have the option either to abide by the testamentary disposition or to take the share due to them by way of reserved portion free from every charge, on abandoning in favour of the disponees of the usufruct or life-annuity the full ownership of the disposable portion.
- (2) Where any of the persons entitled to reserved portion elects in his own interest to abide by the testamentary disposition, it shall, nevertheless, be lawful for any other of such persons to elect to t a k e   t h e   r e s e r v e d   p o r t i o n   o n   a b a n d o n i n g ,   a s   a f o r e s a i d ,   t h e disposable portion.
622. Besides  the  grounds  on  which  a  person  may  become unworthy to inherit, the persons entitled by law to a reserved portion may be deprived thereof by a specific declaration of the testator on any of the grounds specified in this Code, to be stated in the will.
623. Saving  the  provisions  of  article  630,  the  grounds  on which a descendant may be disinherited are the following only:
10. ( a ) if the descendant has without reason refused maintenance to the testator;
11. ( b ) if, where the testator has become insane, the descendant has abandoned him without in any manner providing for his care;

626. (1) If the person disinherited has children or other descendants, the reserved portion of which such person has been deprived shall be due to them.
- (2) In any such case the person disinherited shall not have over the reserved portion the usufruct or administration to which he may be entitled by law.
627. Where the person disinherited predeceases the testator, the disherison shall not prejudice the rights of his descendants.
628. Where  the  person  disinherited  has  no  other  means  of subsistence, those who in consequence of his disherison shall benefit by his reserved portion, shall be bound to give him maintenance to the extent of the fruits of the reserved portion, saving any other right to maintenance competent according to law.
629. Where  the  ground  of  disherison  is  not  stated,  or  is  not proved, the person disinherited shall only be entitled to the reserved portion.
630. Where  the  person  entitled  to  the  reserved  portion  is interdicted on the ground of prodigality, or is so burdened with debts that the reserved portion, or at least the greater part of it, would be absorbed by such debts, it shall be lawful for the testator by an express declaration to disinherit such person, and to bequeath the reserved portion to the children or descendants of such person.

## OF THE RIGHTS OF THE SURVIVING SPOUSE

## OF THE ABATEMENT OF TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITIONS EXCEEDING THE DISPOSABLE PORTION

647. Testamentary dispositions exceeding the disposable portion, shall be liable to abatement and limited to that portion, at the time of the opening of the succession, provided the demand is made within the time established in article 845.
648. For the purpose of determining the abatement, the following rules shall be observed:
3. ( a ) all  the  property of the testator, existing at the time of his death, shall be formed in one bulk, after deducting therefrom the debts due by the estate;
4. ( b ) any  property  which  has  been  disposed  of  by  way  of donation shall be then fictitiously added, such property being reckoned at its value at the time of the donation;
5. ( c ) the disposable portion shall then be computed according to the estate thus formed, regard being had to  the  rights  of  the  surviving  spouse  in  accordance with articles 615 to 639.
650. Where the value of the donations exceeds, or is equal to, the disposable portion, all testamentary dispositions shall be ineffectual.
651. Where  the  testamentary  dispositions  exceed  either  the disposable portion, or the residue thereof after deducting the value of the donations, they shall abate proportionately without any distinction between heirs and legatees.
652. Nevertheless, in all cases where the testator has expressly declared his intention to be that a disposition shall have effect in preference to the others, such preference shall take place, and any such disposition shall not abate except in so far as the value of the property included in the other dispositions shall not be sufficient to make up the share reserved by law.
653. (1) Where the legacy subject to abatement is a thing from which the part exceeding the disposable portion can conveniently and without being injuriously affected be separated, the abatement shall be effected by means of such separation.

664.

847. An inheritance may be accepted unconditionally, or under benefit of inventory.

850. (1) Acceptance may be either express or implied.
- (2) It  is  express,  if  the  status  of  heir  is  assumed  either  in  a public deed or in a private writing.
- (3) It is implied, if the heir performs any act which necessarily implies his intention to accept the inheritance, and which he would not be entitled to perform except in his capacity as heir.
851. A person who, by a judgment of the competent court, has been declared to be the heir, or has been condemned expressly in such capacity, shall be deemed to be the heir with regard to all the legatees and creditors of the inheritance.

- (2) The provisions of sub-article (1) shall also apply in the case of judicial proceedings in respect of possessory actions, in which case the person entitled to succeed shall be considered as de jure curator of the inheritance in terms of article 886(2).
- (3) Sub-article  (2)  shall  only  apply  if  the  person  entitled  to succeed states in the action that he is acting in his capacity of de jure curator.
853. (1) Any  donation,  sale,  or  assignment  of  his  rights  of succession by one of the co-heirs, whether in favour of a stranger or of all or any of his co-heirs, shall imply his acceptance of the inheritance.

11. ( a ) with regard to a renunciation made, even if gratuitously,  by  one  of  the  heirs  in  favour  of  one  or more of his co-heirs;
12. ( b ) with regard to a renunciation made, even in favour of all his co-heirs indiscriminately, when such renunciation is made under an onerous title.
854. Where the renunciation is made gratuitously by one of the co-heirs in favour of all those co-heirs, whether testamentary or heirs-at-law, upon whom, on failure of the party renouncing, his portion of the inheritance would have devolved, it shall not imply acceptance of the inheritance.
855. If the heirs do not agree as to accepting or renouncing the inheritance, the party accepting shall alone acquire all the rights, and become subject to all the liabilities of the inheritance.

857. The heirs who have accepted the inheritance of the person from whom the right referred to in the last preceding article is derived, may nevertheless renounce the inheritance devolved upon, but not yet accepted by such person:

Provided that the renunciation of the inheritance of the said person shall also operate as a renunciation of the inheritance devolved upon him.

858. (1) A  person  who  has  accepted  an  inheritance  cannot impeach the acceptance, unless such acceptance was the result of violence, or of fraud practised upon him.
- (2) Nevertheless, if  a  will  is  discovered  which,  at  the  time  of acceptance, was unknown to the person accepting, such person shall not be bound to discharge the legacies bequeathed in such will beyond the value of the inheritance, saving the reserved portion to which such person may be entitled.
859. The right of accepting a vacant inheritance is prescribed by the lapse of thirty years.

## OF THE RENUNCIATION OF AN INHERITANCE

860. (1) Renunciation of an inheritance cannot be presumed.
- (2) It may only be made by a declaration filed in the registry of the court of voluntary jurisdiction of the island in which the deceased resided at the time of his death or by a declaration made by an act of notary public.
- (3) The  declaration  of  renunciation  referred  to  in  this  article shall not be operative with regard to third parties except from the time when it is registered in the Public Registry according to the provisions of article 330(2).
861. The  heir  who  renounces  a  testate  succession  forfeits  all rights to the intestate succession:
5. Provided that it shall be lawful for such heir to make, in the act of renunciation, a reservation in respect of the reserved portion of the property to which he may be entitled under any of the provisions of articles 614 to 653.
862. (1) The  heir  who  renounces  is  considered  as  if  he  had never been an heir.
- (2) Nevertheless,  his  renunciation  shall  not  operate  so  as  to deprive him of the right to demand any legacy bequeathed to him.

863. (1) In intestate successions, the share of  the  person renouncing accrues to his co-heirs.
- (2) If  the  person  renouncing  is  the  sole  heir,  the  succession devolves upon the person next in degree.
864. (1) No person may take as  the  representative  of  an  heir who has renounced.
- (2) If the person renouncing is the sole heir in his degree, or if all the co-heirs renounce, the children shall take in their own right and shall succeed per capita.

866. (1) The creditors of a person who renounces an inheritance to the prejudice of their rights, may apply to the court for authorization to accept such inheritance in the place of their debtor.
- (2) In  the  case  referred  to  in  sub-article  (1)  of  this  article  the renunciation is annulled not in favour of the renouncing heir, but in favour of the creditors, and only to the extent of the rights of such creditors.
- (3) It  shall  be  lawful  for  any  of  the  co-heirs  of  the  person renouncing to oppose the action of the creditors by paying the sums due to them, and the co-heir effecting payment shall ipso jure be subrogated to the rights of the creditors whose claims he has satisfied.
867. (1) An  heir  who  has  renounced  an  inheritance  may  yet accept such inheritance provided -
10. ( a ) the  right  of  acceptance  shall  not,  in  his  regard,  have lapsed by prescription; and
11. ( b ) the inheritance shall not have been already accepted by other heirs.
- (2) Nevertheless,  such  acceptance  shall  not  operate  so  as  to prejudice any right which may have been acquired by third parties over the property of the inheritance either by prescription, or by virtue of acts validly made with the curator of the vacant inheritance.
868. The court shall, on the demand of any person interested, fix the time of one month, which may, on good grounds, be extended to another month, within which the heir whether testamentary or heir-at-law shall be bound to declare whether he accepts or renounces the inheritance; and in default of such declaration within the said time, original or enlarged, the inheritance shall be deemed to have been renounced.

870. Any  heir  who  misappropriates  or  conceals  any  property belonging to the inheritance, shall forfeit the right to renounce such inheritance, and shall, notwithstanding any renunciation remain pure and unconditional heir.
871. Saving  other  provisions  of  this  Code  with  regard  to renunciations in contemplation of marriage, it shall not be lawful to renounce the inheritance of a living person, or to alienate any eventual rights thereto, except on taking the vows in a monastic order or a religious corporation of regulars.
872. A renunciation  made  on  taking  the  vows  in  a  monastic order or a religious corporation of regulars must be made in a manner that the person renouncing and the order or corporation, may in no case succeed to the property so renounced.
873. It shall, nevertheless, be lawful for the person renouncing as aforesaid to reserve a life annuity on the property so renounced, and, in any such case, the order or corporation may, upon the death of the person renouncing, demand the payment of any amount of the annuity which shall not have been paid to him provided he shall have expressly declared the default of payment and the debt is not barred by prescription.
874. The  renunciation  mentioned  in  article  872  may  be  made even by a minor, provided he has the age required by law for taking religious vows.
875.

876. (1) The annulment of the religious vows shall also bring about the annulment of the renunciation.

## OF THE BENEFIT OF INVENTORY

877. It shall  be  lawful  for  the  heir,  notwithstanding  any prohibition of the testator, to avail himself of the benefit of inventory.

- (2) Where  the  opening  of  the  succession  has  taken  place  in virtue of a judgment declaring that, on account of a long period of absence, the person whose succession is concerned is to be presumed to have died, the said declaration shall be made by the heir in the registry of the court of the island in which such judgment shall have been given.

Minors  and  persons  interdicted  shall  not  be  deemed  to have forfeited the benefit of inventory except on the expiration of one year from the day on which they shall have attained majority, or the interdiction shall have ceased, as the case may be, unless, within such time, they shall have complied with the provisions of the foregoing articles.
886. (1) During  the continuance of the time allowed for making up the inventory and for deliberating, the person entitled to succeed is not bound to assume the status of heir.

- ( c ) opt not to claim and enjoy all benefits under any trust and any will.
- (11) When,  in  the  case  contemplated  in  the  preceding  subarticle, the beneficiary is subject to a mental or physical disability which renders him incapable of sustaining himself, if it appears to the trustee that the trust property is not susceptible of division, sale or reduction to fulfil the claims of a person entitled to the reserved portion in terms of sub-article (10)( a )  without materially prejudicing the interests of the said beneficiary, the trustee may apply to the Court and the Court may order that the property not be sold, divided or reduced until the death of the said beneficiary. Furthermore, and in such case -
- ( a ) the  beneficiary  shall  not  be  entitled  to  demand  the reduction  of  the  trust  settled  in  his  favour  and  claim the reserved portion from the trustee or from the heirs or any other person except that if the property settled in  trust  is  not  equal  to  or  more  than  the  reserved portion,  such  person  may  request  against  any  person other than the trustee that the sum due to him by way of reserved portion be placed under the trust settled in his favour; and
- ( b ) any other person entitled to the reserved portion shall be  entitled  to  apply  sub-article  (10)( b )  at  the  time  of death of the beneficiary unless he had opted as stated in sub-article (10)( c ) within five years of the death of the settlor; and
- ( c ) the trustee shall be deemed to have the power and legal interest  to  pursue  any  claim  for  the  reserved  portion due to the beneficiary against any other person and to receive any sum due into the trust established for the purposes of this sub-article.
- (12) The persons entitled to the reserved portion may choose any of the above options by notice in writing to the trustee and to the other heirs or executors of the estate.
- (13) The action for reduction, whether against trustees or against third parties, shall be barred by the prescription on the lapse of five years to be reckoned from the day of the opening of the succession. The aforesaid time shall also run against minors and persons interdicted and shall not be capable of suspension or interruption by judicial act or otherwise.
- (14) The  settlement  and  holding  of  property  under  trusts  shall not be considered to be in breach of the mandatory provisions of law relating to the reserved portion of any person if the trust is to hold property:

- ( a ) temporarily  and  unconditionally  for  a  person  entitled thereto under fixed trusts; or
- ( b ) until  a  calculation  is  made  to  establish  the  reserved portion  and  thereafter  to  hold  the  same  under  fixed trust for or to distribute the said reserved portion to the person entitled thereto; or
- ( c ) for  a  person  who  suffers  from  a  mental  or  physical disability in terms of sub-article (11).

958N. (1) The provisions of article 605 shall apply to trusts in t h e   s a m e   m a n n e r   a s   i t   a p p l i e s   t o   w i l l s ,   a n d   o n   t h e   e v e n t s contemplated therein, trusts in favour of such a person shall be subject to termination on the demand of the trustee or any interested person.

- (2) Notwithstanding that a trust may have been settled without the reservation of the right of revocation or variation, a settlor may demand the variation of the terms of trust on the grounds specified in article 1787 and the provisions of articles 1788 and 1790 of this Code and those of article 15 of the Trusts and Trustees Act shall apply.

958O. When  there  exist  both  donations  and  settlements,  for purposes of determining the order of transactions and other matters for the purpose of reduction of -

- ( a ) donations in terms of Sub-title VI of Title XIV of Part II of Book Second, and
- ( b ) of settlements in terms of this Title,

donations and settlements shall be treated as forming part of the same type of transactions and they shall be subject to reduction commencing with the latest in date unless the settlor/donor has expressly stated an order he wishes to be applied for such purpose.

958P. For  the  purposes  of  the  calculation  of  the  value  of  an estate for any purposes of this Code, including for the benefit of a claimant of a reserved portion and of an heir for the purposes of collation amongst co-heirs, any settlement of property under trust shall also be included in the estate:

Provided  that  the  settlor  of  property  in  trust  may  exempt such settlement from collation in terms of article 914:

Provided further that if the property settled in trust for the benefit of an heir is collated in the interest of the other co-heirs, such property as has been collated shall thereafter be held by the trustee under separate trust absolutely for the benefit of such heir.

958Q. (1) A  trustee  appointed  in  terms  of  a  testamentary  trust shall not be considered to be a testamentary executor and the provisions of articles 762 to 778 shall not apply to testamentary trustees.

- ( b ) no  provision  in  this  Code  relating  to  inheritance  or succession  to  such  property  including,  but  without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, rights to a reserved portion or similar rights applicable under this Code shall apply to such trust property, at such time or subsequently; and
- ( c ) the  beneficiaries  shall  be  deemed  to  have  capacity  to benefit.
- (2) Once  property  has  been  settled  in  trust  it  shall  not  be affected by a change of domicile of the settlor, even if the settlor subsequently becomes domiciled in Malta.
- (3) For the purposes of this article ''reserved portion'' means the legal rule restricting the right of a person to dispose of his property during his lifetime so as to preserve such property for distribution at his death, or having similar effect.

958S. The right of redemption as provided for in article 912 shall not apply when the transfer of the undivided share of an inheritance shall consist of a settlement of such right under trusts, the beneficiaries of which are the settlor himself, his heirs or the other heirs of the estate or a distribution or reversion thereof to such persons.

958T. The  provisions  of  articles  1000  and  1001  shall  not  be interpreted as creating any limitation on the power of any person to settle a trust or a person to accept to act as trustee under a trust for the benefit of a beneficiary, on the binding nature and effect of any trust or on the enforceablility of such rights as arise under a trust by a beneficiary.

958U. The right of a debtor of a litigious right in terms of article 1483 shall not arise when the settlement involves the assignment of a litigious right under trusts for the benefit of the creditor or creditors who have assigned the debt.

## Title IV

OF OBLIGATIONS IN GENERAL

959. Obligations which are not created by the mere operation of law, arise from contracts, quasi-contracts, torts, or quasi-torts.

## Sub-title I

## OF CONTRACTS

960. A contract is an agreement or an accord between two or more persons by which an obligation is created, regulated, or dissolved.
961. (1) A contract  is  synallagmatic  or  bilateral  when  the contracting parties bind themselves mutually the one towards the other.
- (2) It  is  unilateral  when  one  or  more  persons bind themselves towards one or more other persons without there being any obligation on the part of the latter.
962. (1) When each of the parties undertakes an obligation, the contract is termed onerous.
- (2) When one of the parties gratuitously procures an advantage to the other, the contract is termed gratuitous.
6. 963 . A contract is commutative, when each party binds himself to give or to do a thing which is considered as the equivalent of that which is given to or done for him.
964. When the advantage or loss, whether to both parties or one of them, depends on an uncertain event, the contract is aleatory.
965. Contracts,  whether  they  have  a  special  denomination  or not, shall be governed by the general rules contained in this Title saving such special rules as apply to certain contracts.

## § I. OF THE CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL TO THE VALIDITY OF CONTRACTS

2. ( a ) minors;
3. ( b ) persons interdicted or incapacitated; and
4. ( c ) generally,  all  those  to  whom  the  law  forbids  certain contracts.
968. Any contract entered into by a person who has not the use of reason, or is under the age of seven years is null.
969. (1) Any obligation entered into by a child under the age of fourteen years is also null.
- (2) Nevertheless, where the child has attained the age of nine years, the agreement shall be valid in so far as it relates to the obligations entered into by any other person in his favour.
970. The  provisions  of  the  last  preceding  article  shall  also apply with regard to any person who has attained the age of fourteen years, but has not attained the age of eighteen years, if such person is subject to parental authority, or is provided with a curator, saving always any other provision of law relating to marriage.
971. (1) Subject to any other provision contained in the Commercial Code, any minor who has attained the age of fourteen years, and is not subject to parental authority, nor provided with a curator, may not alienate or hypothecate his immovable property without the authority of the competent court.
- (2) Such  minor  may,  however,  enter  into  other  obligations, saving, in regard to such obligations, any rescissory action which, on the ground of lesion, may be competent to him under the provisions of articles 1214 to 1219.
11. 971A. Notwithstanding any provision of this Code, a child who has attained the age of sixteen years may deposit money in an account opened by the child in his or her own name with any bank, and any money deposited in any such account may only be withdrawn by such child notwithstanding that such money may be subject to the administration, usufruct or authority of any other person. For all purposes of law the child shall with regard to the opening and operation of any such account be considered a major.
972. The  disability  of  persons  interdicted  is  either  general  in regard to all agreements, or special in regard to certain agreements only, as provided in Title IV of Part II of Book Second of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
973. Persons capable of contracting may not set up the nullity of the contract on the ground of the disability of those with whom they have contracted.

## OF CONSENT

974. Where  consent  has  been  given  by  error,  or  extorted  by violence or procured by fraud, it shall not be valid.
975. An error of law shall not void the contract unless it was the sole or principal inducement thereof.
976. (1) An error of fact shall  not  void  the  contract  unless  it affects the substance itself of the thing which is the subject-matter of the agreement.
- (2) The agreement shall not be void if the error relates solely to the person with whom the agreement has been made, unless the consideration of the person has been the principal inducement thereof.
977. (1) The use of violence against the obligor is a cause of nullity, even if such violence is practised by a person other than the obligee.
- (2) Nevertheless,  an  obligation  entered  into  in  favour  of  a person not being an accessory to the use of violence, in consideration of services rendered for freeing the obligor from violence practised by a third party, may not be avoided on the ground of such violence; saving the reduction of the sum or thing promised, where such sum or thing is excessive.
978. (1) Consent  shall  be  deemed  to  be  extorted  by  violence when the violence is such as to produce an impression on a reasonable person and to create in such person the fear of having his person or property unjustly exposed to serious injury.
- (2) In  such  cases,  the  age,  the  sex  and  the  condition  of  the person shall be taken into account.
979. (1) Violence  is  a  ground  of  nullity  of  a  contract  even where the threat is directed against the person or the property of the spouse, or of a descendant or an ascendant of the contracting party.
- (2) Where the threat is directed against the person or property of other persons, it shall be in the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances of the case, to void the contract or to affirm its validity.
980. Mere  reverential  fear  towards  any  one  of  the  parents  or other ascendants or towards one's spouse, shall not be sufficient to invalidate a contract, if no violence has been used.
981. (1) Fraud  shall  be  a  cause  of  nullity  of  the  agreement when the artifices practised by one of the parties were such that without them the other party would not have contracted.
- (2) Fraud is not presumed but must be proved.

## OF THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF CONTRACTS

982. (1) Every contract has for its subject-matter a thing which one of the contracting parties binds himself to give, or to do, or not to do.
- (2) Only the things that are not extra  commercium can be the subject of an agreement.
- (3) The mere use or the mere possession of a thing can like the thing itself, be the subject of a contract.
983. (1) The subject of an obligation must be a thing determinate, at least as to its species.
- (2) The  portion  or  quantity  of  the  thing  may  be  uncertain, provided it is capable of being ascertained.
984. (1) Future things can form the subject of a contract.
- (2) Nevertheless, it shall not be lawful to renounce a succession not yet devolved, or to make any stipulation with regard to any such succession, whether with the person whose succession is concerned, or with any other person, even though with the consent of the former; saving any other provision of the law in regard to any renunciation or stipulation made in contemplation of marriage, or upon the taking of religious vows.
985. Things  which  are  impossible,  or  prohibited  by  law,  or contrary to morality, or to public policy, may not be the subjectmatter of a contract.
986. (1) Stipulations quotae litis are void.
- (2) Saving  the  provisions  of  article  1852  and  of  any  other provision of this Code or of any other law, any obligation to pay a rate of interest exceeding eight per cent per annum is also void in regard to the excess.

## OF THE CONSIDERATION OF CONTRACTS

987. An  obligation  without  a  consideration,  or  founded  on  a false or an unlawful consideration, shall have no effect.
988. The agreement shall, nevertheless, be valid, if it is made to appear that such agreement was founded on a sufficient consideration, even though such consideration was not stated.
989. Where  the  consideration  stated  is  false,  the  agreement may, nevertheless, be upheld, if another consideration is proved.
990. The consideration is unlawful if it is prohibited by law or contrary to morality or to public policy.

991. (1) Where the  consideration  for  which  a  thing  has  been promised is unlawful only in regard to the obligee, any thing which may have been given for the performance of the contract, may be recovered.
- (2) If the consideration is unlawful in regard to both contracting parties neither of them, unless he is a minor, may recover the thing which he may have given to the other party, saving the provision of article 1716.

## § II. OF THE EFFECTS OF CONTRACTS

992. (1) Contracts legally entered into shall have the force of law for the contracting parties.
- (2) They may only be revoked by mutual consent of the parties, or on grounds allowed by law.
993. Contracts must be carried out in good faith, and shall be binding not only in regard to the matter therein expressed, but also in regard to any consequence which, by equity, custom, or law, is incidental to the obligation, according to its nature.
994. Where the subject-matter of a contract is the alienation of the ownership, or of any other right over a certain and determinate thing, such ownership or other right is transferred and acquired in virtue of the consent of the parties, and the thing remains at the risk of the alienee, even though the delivery thereof has not taken place.
995. (1) Where the subject-matter of the contract is an uncertain or indeterminate thing, the creditor does not become the owner of such thing until it has become certain, or the debtor has specified it, and has given notice to the creditor that he has specified it.
- (2) Until the thing has become certain or has been specified, it remains at the risk of the debtor.
996. (1) Nevertheless, with regard to third parties any contract conveying the ownership of immovable property, or any right over such property, shall, in no case, commence to be operative until it has been registered in the Office of the Public Registry, as provided in article 330.
- (2) Where the alienation  is  made  by  judicial  auction  the  note for the registration shall be signed by the registrar of the court under the authority of which the adjudication of the thing shall have taken place.
997. Where  the  thing  which  a  person  has  by  successive agreements undertaken to give or deliver to two or more persons is movable by nature, or a document of title payable to bearer, the person to whom the thing is delivered, and who obtains it in good faith, shall have a prior right over the other or others and shall be entitled to retain it, even though his title is subsequent in date.

Where consideration is unlawful in regard to obligee or to both the obligor and the obligee.

Effects of contracts.

999. (1) A person cannot by a contract entered into in his own name bind or stipulate for any one but himself.
- (2) Nevertheless,  a person  can  bind  himself  in  favour  of another person, to the performance of an obligation by a third party; but in any such case if the third party refuses to perform the obligation, the person who bound himself or promised the ratification shall only be liable to the payment of an indemnity.
1000. It  shall  also  be  lawful  for  a  person  to  stipulate  for  the benefit of a third party, when such stipulation constitutes the mode or condition of a stipulation made by him for his own benefit, or of a donation or grant made by him to others; and the person who has made any such stipulation may not revoke it, if the third party has signified his intention to avail himself thereof.
1001. Contracts shall only be operative as between the contracting parties, and shall not be of prejudice or advantage to third parties except in the cases established by law.

## § III. OF THE INTERPRETATION OF CONTRACTS

1002. Where,  by  giving  to  the  words  of  an  agreement  the meaning attached to them by usage at the time of the agreement, the terms of such agreement are clear, there shall be no room for interpretation.

1003. Where  the  literal  meaning  differs  from  the  common intention of the parties as clearly evidenced by the whole of the agreement, preference shall be given to the intention of the parties.
1004. When a clause is susceptible of two meanings, it must be construed in the meaning in which it can have some effect rather than in that in which it can produce none.
1005. Words susceptible of two meanings shall be taken in the meaning which is more consistent with the subject-matter of the contract.
1006. Whatever is ambiguous shall be interpreted according to the usage of the place where the contract is made.
1007. Customary  clauses  shall  be  deemed  to  be  included  in  a contract, even though they are not expressed.
1008. All  the  clauses  of  a  contract  shall  be  interpreted  with reference to one another, giving to each clause the meaning resulting from the whole instrument.

1009. In case of doubt, the agreement shall be interpreted against

the obligee and in favour of the obligor.

1010. However general may be the terms in which a contract is worded, it shall only extend to the things which the parties appear to have intended to deal with.
1011. Where  in  a  contract  a  case  has  been  specified  for  the purpose of explaining an agreement, it shall not be presumed that the parties, by so doing, intended to exclude other cases not specified, if such other cases may reasonably be construed as being within the scope of the agreement.

## Sub-title II

## OF QUASI-CONTRACTS, TORTS AND QUASI-TORTS

## § I. OF QUASI-CONTRACTS

1012. A  quasi-contract  is  a  lawful  and  voluntary  act  which creates an obligation towards a third party, or a reciprocal obligation between the parties.

1013. Where a person, being of age and capable of contracting, voluntarily undertakes the management of the affairs of another person, he shall be bound to continue the management which he has begun and to carry it out until the person on whose behalf he has acted is in a position to take charge of such management himself, and to do everything which is incidental to or dependent upon those affairs, and he shall be liable to all the obligations which would arise from a mandate.
1014. Where the person on whose behalf the voluntary agent has acted dies before the business is completed, such agent shall be bound to continue the management of the business until such time as the heir is in a position to provide for it himself.
1015. The voluntary agent shall be bound  to use in the management of the business all the diligence of a bonus paterfamilias.
1016. The  provisions  of  the  last  preceding  article  shall  be applied with greater strictness in the following cases:
5. ( a ) where  the  agent  has  intermeddled  with  the  business, notwithstanding the prohibition of the party interested;
6. ( b ) where,  by  reason  of  his  intermeddling,  the  business was not undertaken by a more competent person;
7. ( c ) where the agent himself did not possess the requisite skill.
1017. It shall, in all cases, be lawful for the court to mitigate the damages arising from the imprudence or negligence of the agent, having regard to the circumstances which may have induced him to undertake the business.

1018. If  the  business  was  well  managed,  the  party  interested shall, even though the management may have accidentally failed to

1019. Nevertheless,  where  the  agent  was  under  the  impression that he was managing his own affairs, he shall not be entitled to any indemnity beyond the benefit which the party interested may have actually derived.
1020. Where  a  person  has  intermeddled  with  the  affairs  of another person against the express prohibition of such other person, he shall not be entitled to any indemnity.
1021. A person who receives, whether knowingly or by mistake, a thing which is not due to him under any civil or natural obligation, shall be bound to restore it to the person from whom he has unduly received it.
1022. (1) Where  any  person  pays  a  debt  under  a  mistaken belief that such debt is due by him, he may recover from the creditor the debt so paid.
- (2) Such right of recovery, however, ceases if, in consequence of the payment, the creditor has, in good faith, deprived himself of the proof of, or the security attached to the debt, saving the right of the payer against the true debtor.
1023. (1) Any person who has unduly received the payment of a sum of money, shall, if he was in bad faith, be bound to restore both the capital and the interest thereon as from the day of the payment.
- (2) Where,  however,  he  was  in  good  faith,  he  shall  only  be bound to restore the capital.
1024. Any person who has unduly received any thing, other than money, which is still in his possession, shall be bound to restore it in kind to the party from whom he received it.
1025. (1) If the thing is not in his possession, or has deteriorated, he shall, if he received it in bad faith, be liable to the same obligations as, under articles 556 and 557 are imposed on a possessor in bad faith.
- (2) If he received the thing in good faith, he shall be bound to restore the value thereof or, as the case may be, to make good the deterioration, but only up to the amount of any benefit which, as a result of the alienation or deterioration of the thing, he may have derived; and where he has not yet received the subject of the benefit derived from such alienation or deterioration, he shall only be bound to assign his right of action for the recovery thereof.
- (3) He is not bound to restore the value of the thing if he has lost, given or destroyed it.

1026. (1) The provisions of articles 540 to 545 and 547 shall apply to any person who has unduly received a thing, according as to whether he has received it in good or in bad faith.
- (2) The provisions of articles 548, 549 and 550 shall apply to any such person in all cases.
1027. The action for the recovery of that which may have been unduly given, unless prescribed under any of the provisions contained in the title relating to prescription, shall be prescribed by the lapse of two years from the day on which the person to whom the action is competent shall have discovered the mistake.

1028. Any  person  who  has  given  a  thing  by  mistake  cannot recover it from a third party to whom it was, under any title whatsoever, transferred by the party who had received it.

- 1028A. (1) Whosoever, without a just cause, enriches himself to the detriment of others shall, to the limits of such enrichment, reimburse and compensate any patrimonial loss which such other person may have suffered.

1036. Nevertheless,  where  the  party  injured  cannot  recover damages from such other persons, because they are not liable or because they have no means, and the said party has not, by his own negligence, want of attention, or imprudence, given occasion to the damage, the court may, having regard to the circumstances of the case, and particularly to the means of the party causing the damage and of the injured party, order the damage to be made good, wholly or in part, out of the property of the minor or of the person with a mental disorder or other condition referred to in the last preceding article.

1037 .   Where  a  person  for  any  work  or  service  whatsoever employs another person who is incompetent, or whom he has not reasonable grounds to consider competent, he shall be liable for any damage which such other person may, through incompetence in the performance of such work or service, cause to others.

- (6) Any tacit or express agreement between a hotel-keeper and a guest entered into before any damage to, destruction or loss of, property has occurred and purporting to exclude, reduce or make less onerous the hotel-keeper's liability as established in this article shall be null and void:

Provided that, in the cases referred to in paragraphs ( a ) and ( c ) of sub-article (2) of this article where the damage to, or destruction or loss of, property has not been caused by a person mentioned in the said paragraph ( c ) voluntarily or through gross negligence, any agreement signed at any time by the guest whereby the hotelkeeper's liability is reduced to an amount being not less than one hundred and seventy-four euro and seventy cents (174.70) shall be valid.

- (7) In  this  article  and  in  article  2009  of  this  Code  "guest" means a person who stays at the hotel and has sleeping accommodation put at his disposal therein, but is not an employee in the hotel.

1043. An  action  for  damages  shall  lie  even  where  the  party causing the damage was at the time in a state of intoxication.

Provided that in the case of damages arising from a criminal offence, other than an involuntary offence, and only in the case of crimes affecting the dignity of persons under Title VII of Part II of Book First of the Criminal Code and of wilful crimes against the person subject to a punishment of imprisonment of at least three years under Title VIII of Part II of Book First of the said Code, up to a maximum limit of ten thousand euro (€10,000) or up to such maximum limit as the Minister may by regulations establish both with regard to the maximum amount and about the method of computation depending on the case, the damage to be made good shall also include any moral harm and, or psychological harm caused to the claimant.

- (2) If, however,  the party causing the  damage  has  acted maliciously, the court may, according to circumstances, grant also to the injured party compensation for any other damage sustained by him, including every loss of earnings, if it is shown that the party causing the damage, by depriving the party injured of the use of his own money, had particularly the intention of causing him such other damage, or if such damage is the immediate and direct consequence of the injured party having been so deprived of the use of his own money.
- (3) The sum to be awarded in respect of such loss of earnings shall be assessed by the court having regard to the circumstances of the case.

1050. (1) Where the part of the damage which each has caused cannot be ascertained, the injured party may claim that the whole damage be made good by any one of the persons concerned, even though all or some of them have acted without malice, saving the right of the defendant to seek relief from the other or the others.
- (2) In such case, it shall be lawful for the defendant to demand that all the persons causing the damage be joined in the proceedings in the manner and for the purposes referred to in article 962 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, and the court may apportion among them the sum fixed by way of damages, in equal or unequal shares, according to circumstances; saving always the right of the injured party to claim the whole sum from any one of the persons concerned who in regard to him shall be all condemned jointly and severally.

## Sub-title III

## OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF OBLIGATIONS

## § I. OF CONDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS

## OF CONDITIONS IN GENERAL AND OF THEIR VARIOUS KINDS

1052. An  obligation  is  conditional  when  it  is  made  to  depend upon an uncertain future event, either by suspending it until the event happens, or by dissolving it if the event happens or does not happen.

1053. (1) A condition is  casual  when  it  makes  the  obligation depend upon a fortuitous event beyond the control of the debtor and of the creditor.

- (2) A potestative condition is that which makes the obligation depend upon an event which the one or the other of the contracting parties has the power to bring about or to prevent.
- (3) A  mixed  condition  is  that  which  makes  the  obligation depend upon the will of one of the contracting parties, and, at the same time, upon the will of a third party or upon a fortuitous event.
1054. Any condition contrary to morals, or to public policy, or prohibited by law, or which imposes the performance of an impossible thing, is void, and annuls the agreement dependent thereon.

1055. (1) The  condition  to  forbear  to  do  an  impossible  thing does not void the obligation contracted on that condition.

- (2) The condition, however, to forbear to do a thing contrary to morals or to public policy or prohibited by law may void the obligation.
1056. (1) Where  an  obligation  is  contracted  on  a  condition which makes the obligation depend solely upon the will of the obligor, the obligation is null.
- (2) Nevertheless, where the obligation depends upon an event the happening of which is within the power of the obligor, he is bound if the event happens.
1057. Every condition must be fulfilled in the manner in which the parties have in all likelihood desired and intended that it should be fulfilled.

1058. (1) Where an obligation is contracted on condition that an event shall happen within an appointed time, such condition shall be deemed to have failed if the time expires without the event having happened.

- (2) Where no time is fixed, the condition shall not be deemed to have failed until it is certain that the event will not happen:

Provided that, where the condition consists in an act which can be performed by the obligee, it shall be lawful for the court,

according to circumstances, to fix a time for the fulfilment of the condition, and if, on the expiration of such time, the condition has not been fulfilled, the obligation ceases.

1059. (1) Where an obligation is contracted on condition that an event shall not happen within an appointed time, the condition shall be deemed to be fulfilled both if the time expires and the event has not happened, as well as if, before the expiration of the time, it is certain that the event will not happen.
- (2) Where no time is fixed, the condition is not fulfilled until it is certain that the event will not happen:

Provided that, where the condition consists in an act within the power of the obligor, it shall be lawful for the court to fix a time, and if the time expires and the event constituting the condition does not occur, the condition shall be deemed to be fulfilled, and the obligor shall be bound to perform the obligation.

1060. (1) The condition shall be deemed to be fulfilled if the debtor who is bound under such condition is the person who has impeded the fulfilment thereof.
- (2) The provision of this article shall not apply in any case in which the impediment is due to the exercise of a lawful right not contemplated in the agreement.
1061. (1) A condition, on being fulfilled, shall have a retroactive effect.
- (2) If  the  creditor  dies  before  the  fulfilment  of  the  condition, his rights vest in his heirs.
1062. The creditor may, before the fulfilment of the condition, take all the necessary steps for the preservation of his rights.

## OF THE SUSPENSIVE CONDITION

1063. (1) A  suspensive  condition  is  that  which  makes  the existence of the obligation depend upon a future and uncertain event.
- (2) An obligation under a suspensive condition does not exist before the event happens.
1064. Where  an  obligation  is  contracted  under  a  suspensive condition, and the thing forming the subject-matter of the agreement perishes or deteriorates before the condition is fulfilled, the following rules shall be observed:
4. ( a ) if  the  thing  perishes entirely, without any fault of the debtor, the agreement shall be ineffectual;
5. ( b ) if  the  thing  perishes  entirely,  through  the  fault  of  the debtor,  such  debtor  shall  be  liable  to  the  creditor  for

damages;

- ( c ) if  the  thing  perishes  in  part  only,  or  deteriorates, without any fault of the debtor, the loss shall be borne by the creditor, who shall be bound to receive the thing in the state in which it is without any abatement of the price thereof;
- ( d ) if  the  thing  perishes  in  part,  or  deteriorates,  through the fault of the debtor, the creditor may elect either to demand the dissolution of the agreement, or to claim the thing in the state in which it is, with damages.

1065. An obligation  contingent  on  an  event  which  has  already happened, but is not yet known to the parties, shall be effectual as from the day on which it was contracted, but the debtor may not be compelled to perform it until the unknown event is ascertained.

## OF THE RESOLUTIVE CONDITION

1066. (1) A  resolutive condition is that which, on  being accomplished, operates the dissolution of the obligation, and replaces things in the same state as though the obligation had never been contracted.
- (2) Such  condition  does  not  suspend  the  performance  of  the obligation, but, if the event provided for by the condition happens, the creditor shall be bound to restore that which he may have received.
1067. Where the resolutive condition is  expressly stated  in  the agreement, such agreement shall, upon the accomplishment of the condition, be dissolved ipso jure , and it shall not be lawful for the court to grant any time to the defendant.
1068. A resolutive condition is in all cases implied in bilateral agreements in the event of one of the contracting parties failing to fulfil his engagement:

Provided that in any such case, the agreement shall not be dissolved ipso jure , and it shall be lawful for the court, according to circumstances, to grant a reasonable time to the defendant, saving any other provision of law relating to contracts of sale.

1069. (1) Where the  resolutive  condition,  whether  express  or implied, relates to any case in which one of the parties fails to fulfil his engagement, the party who is the creditor in the undischarged obligation may, at his option, upon the accomplishment of the condition, either demand the dissolution of the contract, or compel the other party to perform the obligation, if this is possible.
- (2) In either case the defendant may be condemned in damages.

## § II. OF OBLIGATIONS WITH A LIMITED TIME

1070. (1) Time is  the  period  fixed  for  the  performance  of  an obligation.
- (2) A time  may  be  established  either  by  fixing  a  certain specified day, or by reference to an event which will certainly happen, although on an uncertain day.
1071. Time shall not suspend the obligation, but shall only delay the execution thereof.
1072. What  is  only  due  at  a  certain  time,  cannot  be  claimed before the expiration of such time, but what has been paid in advance, cannot be recovered even though the debtor at the time of payment may not have been aware of the stipulation as to time.
1073. Time shall always be deemed to be stipulated in favour of the debtor, unless it appears from the stipulation or from the circumstances that it was also agreed upon in favour of the creditor.
1074. In computing a time the day shall be reckoned at twentyfour hours: the month and the year according to the calendar.
1075. The  day  on  which  an  obligation  with  a  limited  time  is contracted, or from which the time is to commence to run, shall not be computed in the time itself.
1076. (1) Public holidays shall not suspend the running of the time:

Provided that where the last day of the time is a public holiday the time shall not be deemed to have elapsed before the next following day, not being a public holiday, shall have expired.

- (2) For  the  purposes  of  this  article,  public  holidays  are  those days in which no ordinary court sitting may be held as provided in article 109 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
1077. Where no time has been fixed for the performance of an obligation, it shall be carried into effect forthwith, unless the nature of the obligation, or the manner in which it is to be carried into effect, or the place agreed upon for its execution, implies the necessity of a time to be, if necessary, fixed by the court.
1078. Where the time for the performance of the obligation has been left to the will of the debtor, or where it has been agreed that the debtor shall discharge the obligation when it will be possible for him to do so, or when he will have the means for so doing, the following rules shall be observed:
4. ( a ) if  the  subject-matter  of  the  obligation  is  the  payment of a sum of money, such obligation shall be performed within two years, if the sum is due without interest, or, within six years if the sum is due with interest;
5. ( b ) if the subject-matter of the obligation is other than the payment of a sum of money, the time within which the obligation  is  to  be  performed  shall  be  fixed  by  the court according to circumstances.

1079. A debtor can no longer claim the benefit of time if he has become insolvent, or if his condition has so changed as to endanger the payment of the debt, or if by his own act he has diminished the security which under the agreement he had given to the creditor, or if he has failed to give the security agreed upon.

## § III. OF ALTERNATIVE AND POTESTATIVE OBLIGATIONS

1080. (1) The  debtor  in  an  alternative  obligation  is  released therefrom by the delivery of one of the two things included in the obligation.
- (2) The debtor may not compel the creditor to receive a part of one thing and a part of the other.
1081. The option shall belong to the debtor, unless it has been expressly granted to the creditor.
1082. (1) Where  the  party  entitled to the option fails to exercise such option within the time expressly agreed upon for the purpose, the right of option shall vest in the other party.
- (2) Where  no  such  time  has  been  agreed  upon,  it  shall  be competent to the court to fix a time, and if the party having the option shall fail to exercise it within such time, the right of option shall vest in the other party.
1083. Where one of the two things promised could not form the subject-matter of the obligation, such obligation shall be deemed to be pure and simple with regard to the other thing.
1084. (1) An  alternative  obligation  shall  become  pure  and simple with regard to the thing which remains, if one of the two things promised perishes, or can no longer be delivered, even if this happens through the fault of the debtor. The value of the thing which perished cannot be offered in its stead.
- (2) If both things perish and the debtor is in fault with regard to one of them, he shall be bound to pay the value of the thing which perished last.

- (2) The  same  rule  shall  apply  with  regard  to  any  judicial demand made by the creditor against one or more of the co-debtors for a portion of the debt.

## § V.OF DIVISIBLE AND INDIVISIBLE OBLIGATIONS

1110. An  obligation  is  divisible  or  indivisible  according  as  to whether the thing or fact forming the subject-matter thereof, is or is not susceptible of division, physically or intellectually.
1111. An obligation is indivisible if, although the thing or fact forming the subject-matter thereof is of its nature divisible, the manner in which such thing or fact has been considered in the obligation does not admit of a performance in part.
1112. An obligation shall not be deemed to be indivisible solely on the ground that it is a joint and several obligation.

## OF DIVISIBLE OBLIGATIONS

1113. (1) An obligation, although susceptible of division, must be performed, as between the creditor and the debtor, as if it were indivisible.
- (2) The divisibility  shall  only  be  applicable  in  regard  to  their heirs, who can claim or are liable to pay the debt only to the extent of the shares competent to them, or for which they are liable as representing the creditor or the debtor.
1114. (1) The  rule  as  to  the  divisibility  of  the  obligation  in regard to the heirs of the debtor shall not apply in the following cases:
4. ( a ) when a determinate thing is due;
5. ( b ) when,  under  the  instrument  of  title,  one  of  the  heirs alone is charged with the performance of the obligation;
6. ( c ) when  from  the  nature  or  the  subject-matter  of  the obligation  or  from  the  purpose  of  the  agreement  it appears  that  the  intention  of  the  parties  was  that  the debt should not be discharged in separate parts.
- (2) In  the  cases  referred  to  in  paragraphs  ( a )  and  ( b )  of  subarticle (1) of this article, the heir who is in possession of the thing, or who is alone charged with the debt, and, in the case referred to in paragraph ( c ) of that sub-article, each of the heirs, may be sued for the whole, saving his right of relief against the other co-heirs.

## OF INDIVISIBLE OBLIGATIONS

1115. (1) Where two or more persons have jointly contracted an indivisible debt, each of such persons is liable for the whole of the debt, although the obligation has not been contracted jointly and severally.
- (2) The  same  rule  shall  apply  with  regard  to  the  heirs  of  a person who has contracted a similar obligation.
1116. (1) Each  of  the  heirs  of  the  creditor  may  demand  the entire fulfilment of an indivisible obligation.
- (2) He  cannot  alone  remit  the  whole  of  the  debt,  or  receive, instead of the thing, the value thereof.
- (3) Where  one  of  the  heirs  has  alone  remitted  the  debt,  or received the value of the thing, it shall not be lawful for any of the other co-heirs to demand the indivisible thing without taking into account the portion of the heir who has remitted the debt or received the value.
1117. The  heir  of  the  debtor,  on  being  sued  in  respect  of  the whole debt, may demand an adjournment to join his co-heirs as defendants in the suit, provided the debt be not of such nature that it  can only be discharged by the heir so sued, in which case judgment may be given against such heir alone, saving his right of relief against the other co-heirs.

## § VI. OF OBLIGATIONS WITH A PENALTY CLAUSE

1118. A  penalty  clause  is  a  clause  whereby  a  person,  for  the purpose of securing the fulfilment of an agreement, binds himself to something in case of non-fulfilment.
1119. (1) The nullity of the principal obligation produces the nullity of the penalty clause.
- (2) The  nullity  of  the  penalty  clause  does  not  produce  the nullity of the principal obligation.
1120. (1) The  penalty  represents  the  compensation  for  the damage which the creditor sustains by the non-performance of the principal obligation.
- (2) The creditor may sue for the performance of the principal obligation instead of demanding the penalty incurred by the debtor.

- (3) In  any  other  case,  the  penalty  shall  be  incurred  when  the debtor is put in default as provided in article 1130.
1122. (1) It  shall  not  be  lawful  for  the  court  to  abate  or mitigate the penalty except in the following cases:
5. ( a ) if the debtor has performed the obligation in part, and the creditor has expressly accepted the part so performed;
6. ( b ) if the debtor has performed the obligation in part, and the part so performed, having regard to the particular circumstances  of  the  creditor,  is  manifestly  useful  to the  latter.  In  any  such  case,  however,  an  abatement cannot be made if the debtor, in undertaking to pay the penalty, has expressly waived his right to any abatement  or  if  the  penalty  has  been  stipulated  in consideration of mere delay.
- (2) Where  an  abatement  is  to  be  made  under  this  article,  the penalty shall be reduced in proportion to the unperformed part of the obligation.
1123. Where  the  subject-matter  of  the  principal  obligation contracted with a penalty clause is an indivisible thing, the penalty is incurred even where only one of the heirs of the debtor infringes the obligation; and in such case, the penalty may be claimed either -
9. ( a ) against the defaulter, for the whole amount, or
10. ( b ) against each co-heir for his respective share, or, where a hypothecary action is competent, even for the whole amount, saving the right of relief against the defaulter.
1124. (1) Where  the  principal  obligation  contracted  with  a penalty clause is divisible, and one of the heirs of the debtor infringes the obligation, the penalty shall be incurred only by such heir, and only for the share of the principal obligation for which he is liable, and no action shall lie against those who have performed the obligation.
- (2) The rule laid down in sub-article (1) of this article shall not apply to cases where the penalty has been stipulated in order that payment should not be made in part, and one of the co-heirs has prevented the performance of the obligation in its entirety. In any such case, such co-heir is liable for the entire penalty, and the others are liable for their respective shares only, saving their right of relief against the defaulter.

Where a fiduciary is vested with ownership of a property, has it registered in his name, holds, exercises control or powers of disposition over such property and for any reason, ceases to act as fiduciary and is thereafter replaced by another fiduciary, the latter shall continue to perform the same fiduciary obligations, as may be applicable at the relevant time:

Provided that:

- ( a ) the  transfer  of  rights  and  obligations  with  respect  to the property subject to fiduciary obligations shall take place in favour of beneficiaries and third parties upon the  execution  of  a  written  instrument  between  the fiduciary ceding his fiduciary obligation and the fiduciary  replacing  him.  The  written  instrument  shall specify  the  property  subject  to  fiduciary  obligations, and  shall  empower  the  new  fiduciary  to  transfer  all rights  and  obligations,  including  possession  and,  or, delivery  of  the  property  in  favour  of  the  beneficiary

and  any  third  party,  as  the  case  may  be,  except  as stated in paragraphs (d) and (e);

- ( b ) for  any  rights  over  immovable  property  to  be  validly vested in the new fiduciary, the execution of a public deed shall be required;
- ( c ) the sole consideration for the said transaction shall be that  referred  to  in  article  958L,  which  shall  apply mutatis mutandis in case of fiduciary obligations other than those arising from trusts, and notwithstanding any other law it shall not be required to state in the relative instrument, including any public deed, the value of the property being transferred or delivered;
- ( d ) the  provisions  of  this  article  shall  also  apply mutatis mutandis to the transfer of a cell from one organisation to  another  or  the  constitution  of  a  cell  as  a  new organisation under articles 20A or 20B of the Second Schedule, as the case may be;
- ( e ) all  rights  and  obligations,  including  any  contracts which  may  be  in  force,  shall  continue  to  operate  in accordance  with  their  terms  with  reference  to  the property  subject  to  fiduciary  obligations  and  shall accrue and be binding on the new fiduciary upon the transfer  and,  or  delivery  to  him  of  the  property  in accordance with applicable law and any written instrument regulating the fiduciary obligations and the property subject to fiduciary obligation and this without  the  need  of  any  notice  to  or  consent  of  any other  person  except  as  provided  in  this  sub-article  or applicable law;
- ( f ) the fiduciary who ceases to act as a fiduciary shall no longer  be  entitled  to  all  the  rights  and  powers  and, subject to paragraph (g), shall be released from all the fiduciary obligations related to the property subject to fiduciary obligations, including any obligations under any contracts, once he has carried out the transfer and delivery of the property to the successor fiduciary after obtaining all such consents as are required to terminate his engagement as fiduciary under any written instrument and observing all formalities under applicable law;
- ( g ) the fiduciary who ceases to act as a fiduciary shall not be released of his obligations towards the beneficiary with respect to any  property subject to fiduciary obligations  he  may  not  have  transferred,  delivered  or accounted for or which may come into his possession thereafter or for any breaches of fiduciary obligations when he was acting as fiduciary;
- ( h ) the fiduciary who ceases to act as a fiduciary shall not be released from any obligations towards third parties which:
- (i) he has expressly entered into in his own personal capacity

Cap. 331.

and interest and not in a fiduciary capacity; or

- (ii)  he  is  personally  liable  for  under  the  provisions  of  this Title  towards  a  third  party  who  was  not  aware  he  was acting  as  a  fiduciary,  unless  the  third  party  expressly releases him from liability;
- ( i ) the  appointment  of  another  fiduciary,  as  aforesaid, shall not be subject to the provisions on assignment of rights nor constitute a novation under the provisions of this Code but shall be regulated by this article and the provisions of the Trusts and Trustees  Act,  when applicable;
- ( j ) any undertaking, guarantee, hypothec, pledge or other forms of security granted by the fiduciary or over or in relation  to  the  property  shall  not  be  affected  in  any manner  by  the  substitution  of  a  fiduciary  and  shall continue to attach to  the  property  in  accordance  with its  terms  and  the  applicable  law  and  when  property subject  to  a  hypothec  or  privilege  is  the  subject  of  a transaction where another fiduciary replaces a fiduciary, the fiduciary replacing the previous fiduciary  and  the  provisions  of  articles  2070  to  2083 shall not apply:

Provided  that  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply where  the retiring fiduciary is already a third party in possession in which case articles 2070 to 2083 shall apply;

- ( k ) the  fiduciary  ceasing  his  functions  or  the  replacing fiduciary shall:
- (i) notify  interested  third  parties  of  such substitution,  at  what  time  and  to  what  extent,  while abiding  with  any  confidentiality  obligations  regarding beneficiaries and their interests;
- (ii) where  rights  over  immovable  property are  subject  to  fiduciary  obligations,  execute  a  public deed with the fiduciary who has ceased to perform his fiduciary obligations to record that the fiduciary obligations relating to such property have been transferred to another fiduciary. Nevertheless, if for any reason the fiduciary ceasing his functions is not able to appear  on  such  public  deed  and  the  property  is  in  the possession of the replacing fiduciary, the latter may state such  facts  as  are  known  to  him,  confirm  that  such property is in his possession and shall declare by means of a written declaration or notification, his acquisition of title over  the  property and  the undertaking  of the fiduciary obligations. The transfer of ownership of such property  shall  take  place  upon  the  execution  of  such public  deed  and  the  same  rules  shall  apply mutatis

mutandis to  other  registered  movable  property  by  the execution of a private writing and any applicable registrations or notifications as may be required by law;

- (iii) in so far as any security forms part of the property  subject  to  fiduciary  obligations  and  it  is  duly registered in the Public Registry, the new fiduciary shall, upon  making  a  unilateral  declaration  relating  to  the relevant security, in accordance with the applicable law, register the substitution resulting from the written instrument between himself and the former fiduciary in the said register;
- ( l ) in cases where the substitution is ordered or approved by a competent court or regulatory authority, then no further consent or agreements which may otherwise be required under  this article, applicable law  or the written instrument regulating the fiduciary obligations, shall be necessary;
- ( m ) the fiduciary who has ceased to perform his functions shall be entitled to be  indemnified  for  liabilities, expenses or losses he may incur with reference to the property subject to fiduciary obligations even after he has  ceased  to  perform  his  functions  except  for  any breaches thereof;
- ( n ) where a fiduciary dies in the course of performing his fiduciary obligation:
- (i) his universal heir who has reached majority and is capable at law, or if more than one, each one  of  such  heirs  severally,  shall  be  deemed  to  be executors ex lege of the property and shall immediately transfer or deliver the property to a successor fiduciary or the beneficiary;
- (ii) should the heir fail to perform the duties in sub-paragraph (i) within thirty (30) days, extendable by the Court, he shall be considered to be the temporary successor fiduciary and shall have the same obligations towards the beneficiaries as the deceased fiduciary until he performs his obligations as aforesaid;
- (iii) should the heir be unable to perform his duties in sub-paragraph (i) for any reason not attributable to himself, he shall apply to the competent court providing the relevant information and seeking an order as stated below;
- (iv) when the deceased fiduciary has appointed a testamentary executor, the above duties, and all relative powers to so act, shall bind only the executor,

unless the executor is also a universal heir in which case sub-paragraph (i) shall apply, such testamentary executor  shall  be  deemed  to  have  all  the  necessary powers for the purposes solely of recovering, transferring or returning the property to another fiduciary or to the beneficiary;

- (v) notwithstanding the above, a beneficiary, the heirs, the executor, as the case may be, may apply to the Court to confirm their powers or may appoint an ad hoc testamentary executor at any time, to act  for  the  estate  of  the  deceased  fiduciary  for  the purposes  of  recovering,  transferring  or  returning  the property to another fiduciary or the beneficiary and the competent  court  may  confirm  to  which  property  such powers refer or may accede to such request notwithstanding  any  contestation  of  the  will  or  his appointment;
- (vi) the successor fiduciary is the person:
- A. designated in any instrument governing the fiduciary obligations; or
- B. designated in accordance with any applicable law; or
- C. appointed  by  the  Court  for  such purposes,  even  if  only  temporarily  for  this purpose, on the demand by application of any interested party;
- ( o ) where the fiduciary is a legal person which is declared bankrupt,  dissolved  or  wound  up,  such  obligations shall bind the last directors jointly and severally or, if a  liquidator  has been appointed, the liquidator, as the case may be, and the provisions of paragraph (j) shall apply mutatis mutandis ;
- ( p ) where  there  is  more  than  one  fiduciary  who  holds, exercises control or powers of disposition over property  for  a  beneficiary,  such  property  shall,  by operation of  law,  consolidate  in  the  ownership  of  the remaining fiduciary or fiduciaries on the death, resignation or removal of a co-fiduciary. The remaining  fiduciary  or fiduciaries shall  execute  a unilateral  declaration  by  public  deed  or  other  writing in  accordance  with  applicable  law,  which  shall  be registered in the relevant register, so as to declare the consolidation in his or their name of the title or control of  such  property  and  the  consolidation  shall  thereon take place without the need of any other formality.

- 1124E. (1)  It  shall  be  competent to any beneficiary, in order to enforce fiduciary obligations owed to him, to exercise a right of action on the basis of the provisions of this Title.
- (2) The demand may be made together with any other action available  under  the  provisions  of  this  Code  or  any  other  law  and where  such  specific  right  of  action  is  not  exercised,  the  remedies contemplated herein may  also be demanded  by  an additional application  to  the  Court,  at  any  time  of  the  proceedings  until  the award of a final judgement by the competent court or the Court of Appeal.
- (3) In  the  case  of  a  fiduciary  obligation  undertaken  solely for  the  achievement  of  a  purpose  and  in  the  absence  of  any beneficiary, the above right of action may be exercised by any person or  body  granted  the  power  to  protect,  supervise  or  enforce  the purpose in the instrument creating the obligation or, in the case of an obligation  undertaken  by  a  public  benefit  organisation,  also  by  the State Advocate.
- 1124F. (1)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Code  or  any other law, an action brought against a fiduciary, or a person considered to be a fiduciary under the provisions of article 1124A -
- ( a ) in  respect  of  any  fraud  or  dishonesty  to  which  such person was a party or of which he had knowledge; or
- ( b ) for  the  recovery  from  the  fiduciary,  or  any  person considered  to  be  a  fiduciary  as  aforesaid,  of  any property subject to fiduciary obligations or previously received by the fiduciary and converted to his use, or for benefits or gains received as a result of breach of duty,

shall  not  be  barred  by  prescription,  notwithstanding  the lapse of time.

The action shall not be barred by prescription irrespective of whether it is brought against the fiduciary by a beneficiary who has suffered  prejudice  as  a  result  of  the  behaviour  of  the  fiduciary  in relation to the same property or property substituting the same.

- (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of article 2140 and without prejudice to article 2155, a fiduciary or any person considered to be subject to fiduciary obligations under this Title, shall not acquire any property held under fiduciary obligations by means of prescription.
- (3) Where the fiduciary or beneficiary acts in bad faith under the provisions of this Code, such act shall be sufficient for an action not to be barred by prescription.
- (4) With the exception of the matters falling within the scope of the preceding sub-article for which there is no prescription, no action may be brought against a fiduciary by a beneficiary for breach of other fiduciary obligations referred to in sub-article (4) of

- ( a ) from the date of the delivery of a written account, or part thereof, of the fiduciary activity to the beneficiary; or
- ( b ) from  the  date  on  which  the  beneficiary  first  had knowledge of the occurrence of the breach of fiduciary duty,

whichever is the earlier date:

Provided  that,  if  the  account  or  part  thereof  is  itself fraudulent  or  dishonest  then,  with  reference  to  the  account  or  the relevant part, the period shall only commence on the date referred to in paragraph (b).

- 1124G . (1)When a fiduciary obligation is imposed or undertaken solely to achieve a designated purpose or purposes, including in the case of a charitable trust or a purpose foundation, without there being a beneficiary, such obligation shall be valid and enforceable, and:

- ( a ) to perform all such obligations as are agreed by him in writing or as may  be  established in the relative instrument under which the fiduciary obligations arise or as may arise under the applicable law;
- ( b ) to  pay the  remuneration to, and all expenses incurred by, the fiduciary as may be established in the relative instrument under which the fiduciary obligations arise or are governed;
- ( c ) subject  to  the  provisions  of  any  special  law  or  this Code which exclude remuneration, where not expressly agreed in the relevant instrument:
- (i) to pay such fees as are reasonable as is

- established  in  agreement  with  all  beneficiaries who are of age or as may be established by the Court; and
- (ii)    the  fiduciary  may reimburse himself or pay out of  the  property  subject  to  fiduciary  obligations all expenses properly incurred by him in connection  with  his  duties,  in  which  case  the fiduciary  shall  notify  the  beneficiary,  or  the persons  required  to  be  notified  in  the  relevant instrument or applicable law, of such reimbursement  in  the  manner  and  at  the  time established by applicable law.
- (2) The beneficiary must at all times act in good faith towards the fiduciary irrespective of the manner by which or by whom the fiduciary has been appointed.
- (3) Subject to the terms  of  the  instrument  governing  the fiduciary obligations, the beneficiary shall, to the extent of the property unless the beneficiary has agreed otherwise, indemnify the fiduciary for any liabilities the fiduciary may incur in the carrying out of his fiduciary duties except to the extent that the fiduciary is guilty of negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud.
- (4) Nothing in this article shall limit the rights or remedies of the fiduciary under this Code or any other law arising from bad faith or other harmful acts on the part of a beneficiary.

- ( b ) it  shall  be  presumed  that  these  provisions  operate consistently  with  particular  rules  applicable  to  any particular  fiduciary  relationship  or  obligation  but,  in case of inconsistency, the particular rules shall prevail over the provisions of this Title;
- ( c ) the provisions of this Title shall apply to all fiduciary obligations, which exist at the time of the coming into force of these provisions, or any amendments thereof, even  if arising before  such  date,  as  well  as  any fiduciary obligations arising thereafter:

## OF THE EFFECTS OF OBLIGATIONS

1125. Where any person fails to discharge an obligation which he has contracted, he shall be liable in damages.
1126. (1) The  obligation  to  give  a  thing  carries  with  it  the obligation to deliver the thing, and to preserve it until the delivery.
- (2) If the debtor is in default for delay in making the delivery, the thing shall be at his risk and peril, even though before such default it was at the risk and peril of the creditor.
1127. In  case  of  non-performance  of  an  obligation  to  do,  the creditor may be authorized to cause the performance thereof himself at the expense of the debtor.
1128. Where the obligation is to forbear to do, the debtor who infringes the obligation is liable in damages for the mere fact of such infringement.
1129. Saving his action for damages, the creditor may demand that anything done in breach of the obligation be undone, and may be authorized to undo it himself at the expense of the debtor.
1130. (1) Where the obligation is to give or to do, and a time is fixed in the agreement, the debtor is in default by the mere lapse of such time, saving, as regards the payment of interest under article 1141, the provisions of that article.
- (2) If no time is fixed in the agreement, or if the time expires after the death of the debtor, the debtor or his heir is not put in default except by an intimation by a judicial act.

1131. The debtor is also liable for damages if the thing which he undertook to give or to do could only be given or done within a certain time, and he has suffered such time to expire.
1132. (1) Saving any other provision of this Code relating to deposits, the degree of diligence to be exercised in the performance of an obligation, whether the object thereof is the benefit of only one of the parties, or of both, is, in all cases, that of a bonus paterfamilias as provided in article 1032.
- (2) This  rule,  however,  is  applied  with  a  lesser  or  a  higher degree of strictness in certain cases specified in this Code.
1133. The debtor, even though there has been no bad faith on his part, shall be liable for damages, where competent, both for the non-performance of the obligation as well as for the delay in the performance thereof, unless he proves that the non-performance or delay was due to an extraneous cause not imputable to him.
1134. The  debtor  shall  not  be  liable  for  damages  if  he  was prevented from giving or doing the thing he undertook to give or to do, or if he did the thing he was forbidden to do, in consequence of an irresistible force or a fortuitous event.
1135. Subject  to  the  exceptions  and  modifications  hereinafter specified, the damages due to the creditor are, generally, in respect of the loss which he has sustained, and the profit of which he has been deprived.
1136. The debtor shall only be liable for such damages as were or could have been foreseen at the time of the agreement, unless the non-performance of the obligation was due to fraud on his part.
1137. Even where the non-performance of the obligation is due to fraud on the part of the debtor, the compensation in respect of the loss sustained by the creditor, and of the profit of which he was deprived, shall only include such damages as are the immediate and direct consequence of the non-performance.
1138. Where the agreement provides that the party who fails to carry it out shall pay a certain sum by way of damages, it shall not be lawful to award to the other party a greater or lesser sum.
1139. Saving any other provision of law relating to suretyship or partnership, where the subject-matter of the obligation is limited to the payment of a determinate sum, the damages arising from the delay in the performance thereof shall only consist in the interests on the sum due at the rate of eight per cent per annum.
1140. The interest referred to in the last preceding article is due, without the creditor being bound to prove any loss.
1141. (1) Where the obligation is  of  a  commercial  nature,  or the law provides that interest is to run ipso jure , interest shall be due as from the day on which the obligation should have been performed.
- (2) In any other case, interest shall be due as from the day of an intimation by a judicial act, even though a time shall have been

1142. The interest  fallen  due  may  bear  other  interest  either,  in virtue of the foregoing provisions, from the day of a judicial demand to that effect, or in virtue of an agreement entered into after the interest has fallen due, provided, in either case, interest be due for a period not less than one year.
1143. It  shall  be  competent  to  any  creditor  in  order  to  obtain what is due to him to exercise any right or action pertaining to his debtor, with the exception of such rights or actions as are exclusively personal.
1144. (1) It shall also be competent to any creditor in his own name to impeach any act made by the debtor in fraud of his claims, subject to the right of the defendant to plead the benefit of discussion under the provisions of articles 795 to 801 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
- (2) Where  such  acts  are  under  an  onerous  title,  the  creditor must prove that there was fraud on the part of both contracting parties.

§ I. OF PAYMENT OF PAYMENT IN GENERAL

1146. Payment means the performance of an obligation, whether the subject-matter of the obligation is to give or to do.
1147. (1) Every  payment  implies  a  debt,  and  what  is  paid without being due may be recovered.
- (2) Nevertheless no action for recovery shall lie if the payment was made in discharge of a natural obligation.
1148. (1) An  obligation  may  be  extinguished  by  payment made by any person concerned in it, such as a co-obligor or a surety.
- (2) An obligation may also be extinguished by payment made by a third party not concerned in the obligation, provided such third party acts in the name and for the discharge of the debtor, or, if he acts in his own name, provided he shall not be subrogated to the rights of the creditor.
1149. (1) A creditor cannot refuse payment tendered by a third party, if the debtor is benefited thereby.
- (2) The  same  rule  shall  be  applicable  even  in  the  case  of  an obligation to do, provided, in such case, the creditor is not interested in having the obligation performed by the debtor himself, and the performance is offered by the third party at the request of the debtor.
1150. (1) Where the payment has for its object the transfer to the creditor of the property of the thing paid, such payment shall not be valid unless it is made by the person who is the owner of the thing.
- (2) Nevertheless, the payment of a sum of money, or of some other thing which is consumed by use, cannot be recovered from the creditor who has consumed such sum or thing in good faith, although the payment has been made by a person who was not the owner of the money or thing.
1151. Any  payment  made  by  a  person  incapable  of  alienating may, in the interest of such person, be annulled.
1152. (1) Payment must be made to the creditor, or to a person authorized by him, or by the court or by law, to receive it.
- (2) A  payment  made  to  a  person  not  so  authorized  becomes valid if the creditor ratifies it or benefits thereby.
1153. Payment  made  in  good  faith  to  a  person  who  is  in possession of the debt is valid, even though the possessor has subsequently suffered eviction in respect of the debt.
1154. Payment made to the creditor is not valid if he is under any disability to receive payment, unless the debtor proves that the thing paid was applied to the benefit of such creditor.

Definition of payment.

Creditor cannot refuse payment by third party.

Where payment transfers the property of the thing.

Annulment of payment made by person incapable of alienating. To whom payment must be made.

Inapplicability of presumption.

1155. Payment made by a debtor to his creditor in contravention of a garnishee order, or any other order of the court shall not be valid with regard to the persons in whose favour the order was issued or given; and such persons may, so far as their rights are concerned, compel the debtor to pay again, saving his remedy against the creditor.

1156. A creditor cannot be compelled to receive a thing different from that which is due to him, although the value of the thing tendered is equal, or even greater; or to receive payment of part of the debt, although the debt is divisible.

1157. The debtor of a certain and determinate thing is discharged by delivering it in the condition in which it is at the time of delivery, provided he was not in default for delay before any deterioration supervened, and such deterioration was not caused through the fault of the debtor or of other persons for whom he is responsible.

1158. Where the debt relates to a thing which is only determinate as to its species, the debtor, in order to be discharged, is not bound to deliver a thing of the best quality, but he cannot deliver a thing of the worst quality.

1159. (1) Payment must be made at the place specified in the contract.
- (2) If  no  place  is  specified,  and  the  thing  due  is  certain  and determinate, payment must be made at the place where the thing forming the subject-matter of the payment was at the time of the contract.
- (3) Where the thing to be given in payment is a sum of money or any other thing which can, without expense, be carried or sent, and both the creditor and the debtor reside in the same island, payment must be made at the house of the creditor.
- (4) In  any  other  case  payment  must  be  made  at  the  place  of abode of the debtor.

1160. In the case of rent, interest, or other periodical payments, if it appears from receipts that the debtor has paid the sums falling due at three consecutive periods, without any reservation as to sums fallen due previously, the latter sums shall be presumed to have been paid.

1161. The debt shall likewise be presumed to have been paid if -
2. ( a ) a  general  account  has  been  taken  between  the  parties of  what  is  due  by  the  one  to  the  other,  at  least  three times  after  the  debt  fell  due,  without  any  mention  of such debts or any other reservation including it; and
3. ( b ) the  demand  in  regard  to  such  debt  is  made  after  the death of the debtor, or after a period of not less than three years from the day of the acquittance relating to the last general account.
1162. In  each  of  the  cases  mentioned  in  the  last  two  preceding articles, the presumption of payment shall not arise if there are

Title VI

OF SALE

## Sub-title 1

## OF THE CONTRACT OF SALE

1346. A sale is a contract whereby one of the contracting parties binds himself to transfer to the other a thing for a price which the latter binds himself to pay to the former.

1347. A sale is complete between the parties, and, as regards the seller, the property of the thing is transferred to the buyer, as soon as the thing and the price have been agreed upon, although the thing has not yet been delivered nor the price paid; and from that moment the thing itself remains at the risk and for the benefit of the buyer.
1348. (1) Nevertheless,  where  movables  are  not  sold  in  bulk but by weight, number or measure, the sale is not complete in that the property does not pass to the buyer and the things sold remain at the seller's risk, until they are weighed, counted or measured.
- (2) The  buyer, however, may  demand  that  the things  be weighed, counted or measured and delivered to him, or, in case of non-performance of the obligation, payment of damages.
- (3) The  seller  may  also  compel  the  buyer  to  perform  his obligation or, in default, to pay damages.
- (4) The  provisions  of  this  article  shall  also  apply  where  the thing sold is an immovable and cannot exactly be determined

before it is measured.

1349. Where, on the contrary, the things are sold in bulk, the sale is complete even though the things are not yet weighed, counted or measured.
1350. (1) A sale is said to be made in bulk, when the things are sold for one and the same price, irrespectively of the weight, number or measure of such things.
- (2) A sale  is  said  to  be  made  by  weight,  number  or  measure, when the price is agreed upon according to the weight, number or measure, whether the sale is in respect of the whole quantity of the things existing in a specified place or in respect only of a part thereof.
- (3) A  sale  is  also  said  to  be  made  by  weight,  number  or measure if the sale is in respect of a specified number of things or of so many kilogrammes or measures of a specified thing, even though one single price has been fixed in respect of such number of things or such quantities of a specified thing.
1351. (1) In regard to things which, according to usage or by virtue of an express agreement, are to be tasted or tried before the purchase, the buyer shall not be bound until he has approved of them.
- (2) This,  however,  shall  not  apply  where  the  thing,  which, according to usage only and not by virtue of an express agreement, is to be tasted or tried before the purchase, has not to satisfy the taste or the individual opinion of the purchaser, but the taste or trial is only necessary in order to ascertain whether the thing is of good and merchantable quality; and in any such case, if the thing is a specific thing and the price has been agreed upon, both parties are bound, but the contract shall be deemed to have been made under a suspensive condition, and the buyer shall be bound to accept the thing and pay the price thereof if it is proved that the thing is of a good and merchantable quality, although he does not approve of the thing.
7. 1351A.  (1)  Notwithstanding  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  subtitle, any agreement relating to the sale or purchase of ships or aircraft, including aircraft engines, shall be governed by:
8. (a) the terms and conditions agreed between the parties as well as by the international usages of trade applicable in the context, and in case of conflict with the provisions  of  this  Code,  such  terms  and  conditions shall prevail; and
9. (b) the special laws relating to merchant shipping and civil aviation, as the case may be.
- (2) For  the  purposes  of  this  article  and  sub-article  (3)  of article 1357, the term "ship" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the Merchant Shipping Act and the term "aircraft" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the Aircraft

- ( a ) the terms and conditions agreed between the parties as well as by the international usages of trade applicable in the context, and in case of conflict with the provisions  of  this  Code,  such  terms  and  conditions shall prevail; and
- ( b ) the special laws relating to merchant shipping and civil aviation, as the case may be.
- (2) For  the  purposes  of  this  article  and  sub-article  (3)  of article 1357, the term "ship" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the Merchant Shipping Act and the term "aircraft" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the Aircraft Registration Act.".
1352. (1) The price must be in money.
- (2) Nevertheless, the contract shall not cease to be a contract of sale if, in addition to the sum of money agreed upon, the buyer binds himself to give some thing in kind by way of a supplement to the price.
1353. (1) The price must be fixed and stated by the parties.
- (2) It  may,  however,  be  left  to  the  decision  of  one  or  more persons specified by the parties; and in such case if such person or any of such persons is unwilling or unable to fix such price, the sale is void.
1354. The price may also be left to the decision of one or more experts not specified by the parties; and, in such case, if the parties fail to agree as to the expert or experts to be appointed, the appointment shall be made by the court.
1355. In all cases where the price is left to the decision of two or more persons, the price shall, if the persons are more than two, be determined by the opinion of the majority; but if the persons are only two and do not agree, or if they are more than two and fail to agree between them in such a way that no majority of votes can be obtained, an average shall be taken of the sums fixed by each of them.
1356. A sale can be made at the price current at a given time; and such price shall be deemed to be the average current price at the place and time where and when the contract is to be performed.
1357. (1) A promise to sell a thing for a fixed price, or for a price to be fixed by one or more persons as stated in the foregoing articles, shall not be equivalent to a sale; but, if accepted, it shall create an obligation on the part of the promisor to carry out the sale, or, if the sale can no longer be carried out, to make good the damages to the promisee.
- (2) The effect of such promise shall cease on the lapse of the time agreed between the parties for the purpose or, failing any such

agreement, on the lapse of three months from the day on which the sale could be carried out, unless the promisee calls upon the promisor, by means of a judicial intimation filed before the expiration of the period applicable as aforesaid, to carry out the same, and unless, in the event that the promisor fails to do so, the demand by sworn application for the carrying out of the promise is filed within thirty days from the expiration of the period aforesaid.

- (3) A promise of sale or purchase, by whatever name called, of ships and aircraft, including an aircraft engine, shall be regulated by the provisions of any agreement between the vendor and the purchaser in accordance with its terms as well as by the international usages of trade applicable in the context. Sub-article (2) shall not apply in such cases and:
2. ( a ) the effect of such promise shall cease on the lapse of time  or  on  the  events  agreed  between  the  parties  for the purpose; and
3. ( b ) any notices which may be required to be given by the parties  may  be  given  by  notice  in  writing  in  any manner, including by electronic means.
1358. The  provisions  of  the  last  preceding  article  shall  also apply to a promise to sell at a fair price.
1359. Where in any promise to sell, earnest has been given, each of the parties shall be at liberty to recede from the contract: the party giving the earnest forfeiting such earnest, and the party receiving the earnest returning double the amount thereof, saving any other usage in regard to the particular contract in respect of which earnest has been given.
1360. The provisions relating to a promise to sell, shall apply to a promise to buy.
1361. (1) All expenses of or incidental to the contract of sale, including the expense necessary for freeing any immovable from the fetters of any entail or from any hypothec, easement or other burden to which the immovable may be subject, in accordance with the provisions contained in Title II of Part II of Book Second of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, shall be at the charge of the buyer.
- (2) Brokerage  as  well  as  any  fee  due  to  the  experts  or  other persons mentioned in article 1353 shall be borne by the seller and buyer one-half each.
1362. In  the  absence  of  an  agreement,  brokerage  shall  be regulated at the rate of one per centum i n  the  case of sale of movables, and two per centum in the case of sale of immovables.
1363. (1) The sale of immovable property shall be null if not made by a public deed.

1365. All persons may buy or sell, except those who are by law prohibited from so doing.

1366. A  contract  of  sale  between spouses is null, except in the following cases:

- ( a ) when the spouse assigns property to the other spouse in payment  of  a  sum  owed  to  that  spouse  in  respect  of  a dowry;
- ( b ) when the object of the sale or assignment which one of the spouses makes to the other is the payment of a debt due  to  the  buyer  or  assignee,  or  the  investment  of money belonging to such buyer or assignee:

P r o v i d e d   t h a t   w h e r e   i n   t h e   c a s e s   a f o r e s a i d   a n y   i n d i r e c t advantage results to either of the spouses, it shall be lawful for the heirs of the other spouse, or for any other person interested, to demand that the contract be rescinded pro tanto.

1367. The  provisions  of  the  last  preceding  article  in  so  far  as they prohibit either of the spouses from buying property from the other, shall not apply to cases where property is sold by auction on the demand of the creditors of the spouse to whom such property belongs.
1368. The  sale,  however,  made,  either  directly  or  through intermediaries, to tutors or curators in regard to property belonging to the persons under their tutorship or curatorship, or to agents in regard to property which they are authorized to sell is null, even though such sale was made by judicial auction.
1369. Any sale or assignment of lawsuits or of litigious rights or actions made, either directly or through intermediaries, to any judge or magistrate is also null.

1372. Saving  the  provisions  of  article  559  and  the  provisions relating to Il-Monti in regard to pledges, the sale of a thing belonging to another person is void:

## Sub-title IV

## OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER

1378. The  seller has  two  principal  obligations,  namely,  to deliver, and to warrant the thing sold.

## § I. OF DELIVERY

1379. The delivery of immovable property takes place ipso jure on the publication of the contract of sale, saving, as regards the delivery of possession of property sold by judicial auction, the provisions of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.

1380. The  delivery  of  movable  property  takes  place  either  by handing the property to the buyer, or by handing to him the key of the place in which the property is lying, or by handing to him the documents of title the delivery of which operates, according to law, the transfer of the property to which such documents refer, or by causing the buyer to be acknowledged by the persons in whose possession the property exists.

1381. The delivery of movable property takes place also by the mere consent of the parties -

- ( a ) when the thing sold is already in the possession of the buyer; or
- ( b ) when  the  seller  who  has  reserved  to  himself  the enjoyment  of  the  thing  sold  acknowledges  that  he holds the thing on behalf of the buyer; or
- ( c ) when the transfer of the thing sold cannot be effected at the time of the sale:

Provided that in the cases mentioned in paragraphs ( b ) and ( c ), such delivery shall not operate to the prejudice of third parties.

1382. The delivery of incorporeal things takes place either by the use which the buyer makes of such things with the consent of the seller, or by handing over the documents of title in the case of any right the title to which is transferable by endorsement or delivery.

1383. (1) The  expenses  of  delivery  are  at  the  charge  of  the seller.
- (2) Such expenses shall include those of weighing, counting or measuring the thing, where the sale is made by weight, number or measure.
- (3) The expenses of weighing, counting or measuring are at the charge of the buyer where the sale is made in bulk and the weighing, counting or measuring is required by the buyer in order to ascertain whether the thing sold is according to the quantity stated or promised to him.

(4) The expenses of carriage are at the charge of the buyer.

1384. Delivery must be made at the place where the thing was at the time of the sale.

1385. If the seller fails to make delivery at the time agreed upon, the buyer may elect either to demand the dissolution of the contract or to demand that he be placed in possession of the thing sold, provided the delay has been caused solely by the seller.

1386. In all cases, the seller is liable for damages if the buyer has sustained any loss from the non-delivery of the thing at the time agreed upon.

1387. Where  a  person  has  bound  himself  to  deliver  goods  to arrive on a ship which he has reserved to name within a specified time and such person fails to name the ship within the said time, such person shall, besides being answerable for damages, be liable to deliver, within a time to be fixed by the court, according to circumstances, other goods of the same quality and quantity as those forming the subject of the contract.

1388. The  same  rule  shall  apply  where  a  person  has  bound himself to deliver goods to arrive on a ship named in the contract and fails to make delivery within the time agreed upon, unless he proves that he used due diligence for the goods to arrive within the time agreed upon and that the default of arrival of such goods within such time was due to a vis major .

1389. Where the seller has bound himself to deliver, within a specified time, things which have to be weighed, counted or measured, he shall not be deemed to perform the obligation if he refuses to deliver the things to the buyer who presents himself to take delivery thereof in sufficient time for the things to be weighed, counted or measured before the expiration of the time so specified:

Provided that where the seller is ready to make delivery of the t h i n g s   i n   s u f f i c i e n t   t i m e   s o   t h a t   t h e   w e i g h i n g ,   c o u n t i n g   o r measuring thereof may be conveniently commenced before the expiration of the specified time, it shall not be lawful for the buyer, even though he shall have previously in vain presented himself to take delivery of the things, to demand the dissolution of the sale, saving his right to maintain an action for damages as provided in articles 1385 and 1386.

1390. If the thing which the seller offers to deliver is not of the quality promised, or is not according to the sample on which the sale was made, the buyer may elect either to reject the thing and demand damages, or to accept the thing with a diminution of the price upon a valuation by experts.

1391. The  seller  is  not  bound  to  deliver  the  thing,  if  the  buyer does not pay the price thereof, unless the seller has allowed the buyer time for payment.

1392. (1) Nor shall the seller be bound to make delivery of the thing, even though he has allowed the buyer time for the payment of the price, if, since the sale, the buyer has by his own act diminished the security which by the contract he had given to the

- (2) Nor shall he be bound to make delivery if, since the sale, the buyer has become a bankrupt, or insolvent, or his condition has been so altered that the seller is in danger of losing the price.
- (3) The same rule shall apply where, although the buyer was in a state of bankruptcy or insolvency at the time of the sale, such state did not reveal itself except after the sale and it was not known to the seller at the time of the sale.
- (4) In  the  aforesaid  cases,  however,  the  seller  is  bound  to deliver the thing if the buyer gives him security for the payment of the price at the time agreed upon.
1393. The thing must be delivered in the same state in which it was at the time of the sale.
1394. (1) From the day of the sale, all fruits shall belong to the buyer.
- (2) In the case of a sale made under a suspensive condition, all fruits which fall due or are collected before the fulfilment of the condition shall belong to the seller.
1395. The fruits which are uncut or unplucked at the time of the sale, or, where the sale is made under a suspensive condition, at the time of the fulfilment of the condition, shall belong to the buyer although they had been sown by the seller.
1396. (1) The rent of rural tenements which had not fallen due at the time of the sale or at the time of the fulfilment of the condition shall also belong to the buyer.
- (2) In  the  case,  however,  of  urban  tenements  or  of  movables, the rent or the portion of the rent in respect of the period during which the sale was made or the condition was fulfilled, shall be divided between the seller and the buyer in proportion to the time elapsed before the sale was made or the condition was fulfilled and the time that elapsed afterwards.
1397. In  the  case  of  sale  of  a  ship  while  on  her  voyage,  the freight of that voyage shall belong to the buyer.
1398. The obligation of delivering the thing shall include that of delivering its accessories and everything that is intended for its perpetual use.
1399. The seller is bound to deliver the full quantity of the thing as stipulated in the contract, subject to the modifications contained in the following articles.
1400. (1) Where  the  sale  of  immovable  property  has  been made with an indication of the quantity at so much per measure, the seller shall be bound to deliver to the buyer the quantity stated in the contract if the latter requires it.
- (2) If  this  cannot  be  done,  or  if  the  buyer  does  not  require  it, the seller is obliged to accept a proportionate reduction of the price.

1401. If,  on  the  contrary,  in  the  case  mentioned  in  the  last preceding article, the quantity is found to be greater than that stated in the contract, the buyer shall be bound to pay a supplement:

Provided that where the overplus exceeds the twentieth part of the quantity stated in the contract, the buyer shall be at liberty to repudiate the sale.

1402. In  all  other  cases,  whether  the  sale  is  in  respect  of  a specified and limited corpus , or whether it is in respect of distinct and separate tenements, or whether, in the sale, the measure is first stated, or the corpus is first mentioned followed by an indication of the measure, the indication of the measure will not entitle the seller to any increase of price in respect of any excess in such measure, nor the buyer to any diminution of price in respect of any deficiency in such measure, unless the difference between the actual measure and that stated in the contract is more than onetwentieth whether in excess of or below the value of all the things sold:

Provided that no claim may be enforced for an increase or a diminution of the price, notwithstanding that the difference is more than one-twentieth, whether in excess of or below the aforesaid value, if the thing was sold by judicial auction or if it was expressly stipulated that there should be no warranty as to quantity or if the thing was sold tale quale , saving, where the sale was not made by judicial auction, any remedy allowed in law in case of lesion.

1403. Where  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  last preceding article an increase of the price is to be paid on account of an excess in the measure, the buyer may elect either to repudiate the contract or, if he retains the tenement, to pay the overplus, together with interest.

1405. Where two tenements have been sold by one and the same contract, and for one and the same price, the measure of each tenement being specified in the contract, and it is found that one of the tenements is smaller and the other larger than the measure specified, set-off takes place to the extent of the difference; and an action for an increase or diminution of price is only maintainable in accordance with the rules set forth in the foregoing articles.

1406. In  all  cases where an increase or a diminution of price is due, the price shall be increased or diminished only to the extent by which the excess or deficiency of the quantity is greater than that allowed by law.

## § II. OF WARRANTY

1408. The  warranty  which  the  seller  owes  to  the  buyer  is  in respect of the quiet possession of the thing sold and of any latent defect therein.

## OF WARRANTY OF THE QUIET POSSESSION OF THE THING SOLD

1409. Although no stipulation of warranty has been made in the contract of sale, the seller is in law bound to warrant the buyer against any eviction which deprives him, in whole or in part, of the thing sold, and against any easement or burden on the same, claimed by others, and not stated in the contract.
1410. It shall be lawful for the parties, by special agreement, to add to, or diminish the effects of such implied warranty, or to stipulate that the seller shall not be liable to any warranty.
1411. Although it is agreed that the seller should not be subject to any warranty, nevertheless he shall be liable to that warranty which arises from his own act; and any agreement to the contrary is void.
1412. Even in case of a stipulation of no warranty, the seller, in case of eviction shall, in the absence of an express agreement to the contrary, be bound to return the price.
1413. Where  there  is  a  promise  of  warranty  or  where  no stipulation has been made in regard thereto, the buyer shall upon eviction be entitled to claim from the seller -
6. ( a ) the return of the price;
7. ( b ) the return of the fruits, if the buyer has been obliged to return them to the owner who has recovered the thing;
8. ( c ) all  judicial  costs,  including those for giving notice of the suit to the person from whom he derives his title;
9. ( d ) damages, including the lawful expenses of the contract and  any  other  lawful  expense  incurred  in  connection with the sale.
1414. (1) Where,  at  the  time  of  eviction,  the  thing  sold  has decreased in value or has considerably deteriorated, either through the negligence of the buyer or by irresistible force, the seller is still bound to return the full price.
- (2) Where, however, the buyer has derived a benefit from the

deterioration occasioned by him, the seller shall be entitled to deduct from the price a sum corresponding to such benefit.

1415. If,  at  the  time of eviction, the thing sold has increased in value, even irrespective of the act of the buyer, the seller shall be obliged to pay to the buyer the amount exceeding the price of the sale.
1416. (1) The seller is bound to repay to the buyer or to cause to be repaid to him by the person who has recovered the tenement all expenses incurred by him in connection with any repairs or useful improvements made on the tenement.
- (2) Where the seller has sold the tenement of another person in bad faith, he shall be bound to pay to the buyer all expenses, even decorative expenses, which the latter may have made on the tenement.
1417. (1) Where the eviction is only of part of the thing, and such part is of such importance in relation to the whole that without it the buyer would not have bought the thing, he may within a year from the day on which the judgment as to the eviction has become final and absolute, demand the dissolution of the sale.
- (2) The  said  time  shall  run  as  provided  in  sub-article  (2)  of article 1407.
1418. Where, in the case referred to in the last preceding article, the buyer does not elect to dissolve the sale, the value to be refunded to him by the seller in respect of the part affected by the eviction shall be determined not in proportion to the entire price of the sale but in accordance with a valuation in which regard will be had to the time of the eviction, irrespective of any increase or decrease in the value of the thing sold.
1419. (1) Where the tenement sold is subject to non-apparent easements whereof no declaration was made and such easements are of such importance that it may be presumed that the buyer would not have bought the tenement if he had been given notice of t h e m,  he  may  demand either the dissolution of the sale or compensation.
- (2) The provisions of this article shall not apply in the case of a judicial sale by auction.
1420. Where,  however,  a  tenement  has  been  sold  as  free  and exempt from any easement or other burden, or where the warranty has been otherwise expressly promised, in such cases the buyer may demand either the dissolution of the sale or compensation, if the seller shall not cause any easement or other burden not declared in the contract to cease, even though such easement or other burden be apparent, and it be proved that it was known to the buyer at the time of the sale, unless it is clearly shown that it was not the intention of the parties to include such easement or burden in the promise of warranty.

1421. Where the buyer has prevented eviction of the tenement by paying a sum of money, the seller may free himself of all the consequences of the warranty by refunding to him the sum paid together with interest, and all expenses.
1422. The  warranty  against  eviction  ceases  if  the  buyer  has suffered a final and absolute judgment to be given against him without making the seller a party to the suit, if the latter proves that he could have set up a good defence, not set up by the buyer, whereby the action would have been dismissed.
1423. (1) In all  cases where a shorter period is not fixed, the action for breach of warranty against eviction shall be barred by the lapse of two years to be reckoned from the day on which the judgment against the buyer has become final and absolute.
- (2) The said period of limitation shall run as provided in subarticle (2) of article 1407.

## OF WARRANTY IN RESPECT OF LATENT DEFECTS OF THE THING SOLD

1424. The seller is bound to warrant the thing sold against any latent defects which render it unfit for the use for which it is intended, or which diminish its value to such an extent that the buyer would not have bought it or would have tendered a smaller price, if he had been aware of them.
1425. The  seller  is  not  answerable  for  any  apparent  defects which the buyer might have discovered for himself.
1426. Nevertheless,  he  is  answerable  for  latent  defects,  even though they were not known to him, unless he has stipulated that he shall not in any such case be bound to any warranty.
1427. In  the  cases  referred  to  in  articles  1424  and  1426,  the buyer may elect either, by instituting the actio redhibitoria ,  to restore the thing and have the price repaid to him, or, by instituting the actio aestimatoria , to retain the thing and have a part of the price repaid to him which shall be determined by the court.
1428. (1) Where two or more things are sold together, so that one would not have been sold or bought without the other, and one of such things has a defect which gives rise to the actio redhibitoria or aestimatoria , the buyer may not institute the actio redhibitoria but in respect of all the things sold, although a price was specified in respect of each.
- (2) Where,  however,  the  things  sold  together  are  independent of one another, the said action may not be instituted but in respect of the defective thing, although all the things had been sold for a single price; and in such case the seller is bound to repay the price of such thing according to a valuation to be made on the basis of the total price agreed upon.

1429. (1) If  the  defects  of  the  thing  sold  were  known  to  the seller, he is not only bound to repay the price received by him but he is also liable in damages towards the buyer.
- (2) If the defects were not known to the seller, he is only bound to repay the price and to refund to the buyer the expenses incurred in connection with the sale.
1430. (1) If the defective thing perishes in consequence of its defects, the loss is borne by the seller, who shall be bound to repay the price to the buyer and to indemnify him as provided in the last preceding article.
- (2) If the thing perishes by a fortuitous event, the loss is borne by the buyer.
1431. (1) The actio  redhibitoria and  the actio  aestimatoria shall, in regard to immovables, be barred by the lapse of one year as from the day of the contract, and, in regard to movables, by the lapse of six months as from the day of the delivery of the thing sold.
- (2) Where,  however,  it  was  not  possible  for  the  buyer  to discover the latent defect of the thing, the said periods of limitation shall run only from the day on which it was possible for him to discover such defect.
- (3) The said periods of limitation shall run as provided in subarticle (2) of article 1407.
1432. The  a ctio  redhibitoria and  the actio  aestimatoria cannot be maintained in case of judicial sales by auction.

## OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BUYER

1433. If the time and place for the payment of the price are not stated in the contract, the buyer must pay at the time and place of the delivery of the thing.

3. ( a ) if  the  thing  sold  and  delivered  yields  fruits  or  other profits;
4. ( b ) if,  even  though  the  thing  yields  no  fruits  or  other profits, he has been called upon by means of a judicial intimation to pay the price;
5. ( c ) if  the  delivery  of  the  thing,  being  movable,  has  not taken  place  through  the  fault  of  the  buyer,  and  the seller  has  called  upon  him,  by  means  of  a  judicial

intimation, to take delivery of the thing:

Provided that in the cases mentioned in paragraphs ( b ) and ( c ), interest  shall  run  only  from  the  day  of  the  service  of  the  said judicial intimation.

1435. (1) The  buyer  is  not  bound  to  pay  interest  during  the time allowed to him in the contract for the payment of the price.
- (2) Nevertheless,  any  time  allowed  by  the  seller  after  the contract of sale shall not operate as a waiver of the interest on the price, unless such time be allowed under a will.
1436. If  the  thing  is  capable  of  yielding  fruits  or  other  profits, the buyer shall still be bound to pay interest on the price, even though owing to a fortuitous event or for any other cause the thing shall have yielded no fruits or other profits during the time when the price was still owing.
1437. (1) If  the  buyer  is  disturbed  in  the  possession  of  the thing or has reasonable cause to fear that he will be so disturbed, by any action hypothecary or for the recovery of the thing rei vindicatio , he may suspend the payment of the price until the seller shall have caused the molestation to cease or shall have removed the cause for which such molestation is feared, unless the seller elects to give security, or unless it was agreed that the buyer was to pay notwithstanding any molestation.
- (2) Nevertheless, even in the case mentioned in this article, in the event of any of the circumstances referred to in article 1434, the buyer, if he suspends payment of the price, shall owe interest thereon, unless he elects to pay the price into court.
1438. (1) The  seller  of  an  immovable  cannot  demand  the dissolution of the sale on the ground that the price has not been paid to him.
- (2) In  the  case,  however,  of  goods  or  other  movables,  the dissolution of the sale, even though no express resolutive condition is attached to the contract, shall take place ipso jure in favour of the seller, if the buyer previously to the expiration of the time fixed for the delivery of the thing, has not presented himself to take delivery thereof or if on presenting himself to take delivery of the thing he has not concurrently tendered the price, unless a term of credit has been agreed upon for the payment thereof.
1439. If the sale of a movable was made without any stipulation as to credit, the seller may, in default of payment, take back the thing sold, if it is still in the actual possession of the buyer, or restrain the buyer from reselling the thing, provided the demand for the recovery of the thing be made within fifteen days of the delivery and the thing be in the same condition in which it was at the time of the delivery.

## OF THE DISSOLUTION AND RESCISSION OF SALES

1440. Independently  of  the  causes  of  rescission  or  dissolution already mentioned in this Title, and of those which apply to all agreements, a contract of sale may be, in whole or in part, dissolved by the exercise of the right of redemption and may be rescinded on the ground of lesion.

## OF REDEMPTION

1441. The right of redemption is created by agreement.

1442. The action for the recovery of an immovable, in pursuance of a right of redemption, may be instituted not only against the buyer, but also against any other possessor of the immovable; and upon the re-sale, the immovable passes to the party exercising the right of redemption, free from any hypothec, easement or other burden with which the buyer or other possessor may have charged it;  saving, in regard to any contract of lease, the provisions contained in articles 1530 and 1531.

1443. The party exercising the right of redemption is bound to return to the party against whom such right is exercised the price of the sale giving rise to the exercise of such right, and any other lawful expense incurred by the buyer in connection with such sale, as well as all necessary and useful expenses made on the thing either by the buyer or by any other possessor, even though for any cause whatsoever for which neither the party against whom the said right is exercised nor any other former possessor is responsible, the effect of such expenses no longer exists.

1444. The  party  against  whom  the  said  right  is  exercised  is entitled to interest from the day of the respective disbursements which according to the last preceding article are to be refunded to him, subject, however, to the deduction of the value of the fruits which, as from the day of the sale giving rise to the exercise of the right of redemption he or any other former possessor has collected or by the use of the diligence of a bonus paterfamilias could have collected:

Provided that he may retain the fruits aforesaid and waive his right to interest.

1445. The right to interest of the party against whom redemption is exercised shall cease as from the day on which he is notified of the deposit of the sums which are to be refunded to him, provided the payment out of such deposit be not, without just cause, restrained by the party exercising the right of redemption, in which case, the right to interest will not cease except from the day on which the restraint ceases.

1446. From the same day on which his right to interest ceases, the party against whom the right of redemption is exercised is bound to restore to the party exercising such right all fruits which up to the day of the release of the thing he has collected or, by the use of the diligence of a bonus paterfamilias , could have collected.
1447. Fruits which are pending on the day of the release of the thing shall belong to the party exercising the right of redemption, subject, however, to his obligation to reimburse the expense incurred for their production and preservation.
1448. (1) The right of redemption is exercised by presenting a schedule of redemption, in the registry of the competent court, regard being had to the place of residence of the possessor of the thing.
- (2) The party exercising the right of redemption, however, shall be deemed to have validly exercised such right by presenting the schedule in the registry of the competent court according to the place of residence of the buyer, unless he shall have previously been, by means of a judicial intimation, informed of the transfer of the thing from the buyer to another person; and in such case all subsequent acts relating to the right of redemption so exercised shall be presented in the same court.
1449. The  party exercising the right of redemption  shall, together with the said schedule, or within ten days from the presentation thereof, deposit a sum which will include -
6. ( a ) the price of the sale giving rise to the exercise of such right;
7. ( b ) the  fees  of  the  notary  before  whom  the  deed  of  such sale was received;
8. ( c ) the fees paid for the registration of the said deed in the Public  Registry  where  such  registration  has  taken place;
9. ( d ) any other lawful expense which from the deed of that sale  appears,  or  which  the  party  aforesaid  otherwise knows  to  have  been  incurred  by  or  charged  to  the buyer.
1450. (1) Where a right  of  redemption  has  been  exercised,  it may not be impeached on the ground that the deposit was made after the time fixed for the exercise of such right, provided the deposit is made within the ten days mentioned in the last preceding article.
- (2) Where, however, the deposit is not made within the ten days as aforesaid the schedule of redemption shall cease to be effectual, even though the deposit shall have been made before the lapse of the time fixed for the exercise of the said right, saving the power of the party presenting the schedule to exercise again the right of redemption by presenting a fresh schedule within such time, and saving also any other provisions contained in articles 1451 to 1468.

1451. (1) Nor may the exercise of the right of redemption be impeached for default of the deposit in whole or in part, if the party exercising such right, instead of the deposit or of the deficiency in the amount of the deposit, has offered to set off an equal sum, liquidated and exigible, owing to him by the party against whom the said right is exercised, or if, where the default of the deposit is only in part, it clearly appears from the circumstances that the deficiency was due to inadvertence or error.
- (2) The fact, however, that the deficiency was due to inadvertence or error, shall not benefit the party exercising the said right, unless he shall supplement the deposit within ten days from the day on which the party against whom the said right is exercised shall have, by means of a judicial act, called upon him to do so.
1452. The party exercising the right of redemption may recede therefrom until the party against whom such right is exercised shall have signified, by means of a judicial act, his acceptance thereof.
1453. (1) The party against whom the said right is exercised is not bound to make the re-sale of the thing in favour of the party exercising such right until the latter shall have fulfilled all his obligations in accordance with the provisions of articles 1443, 1444 and 1445.
- (2) The  expenses  of  the  re-sale  shall  be  at  the  charge  of  the party exercising the said right.
1454. (1) The  party  against  whom  the  right  of  redemption  is exercised may at any time after the presentation of the schedule of redemption, demand the liquidation of the expenses, necessary or useful, to which he is entitled, and compel the party exercising such right to pay the said expenses on the day which, on the demand of the former, the court shall have fixed for the re-sale.
- (2) The  party  exercising  the  right  of  redemption  may  also  at any time after the presentation of the schedule, demand that the expenses aforesaid be liquidated and that the defendant be condemned to make the re-sale at such time and in such manner as the court shall direct.
1455. Where the thing is damaged in consequence of a fortuitous event, the party exercising the right of redemption shall not be entitled to any abatement of the sums due by him under the provisions of the foregoing articles.
1456. Where  the  thing  has  been  damaged  by  the  party  against whom the right of redemption is exercised or by any other former possessor, the party exercising such right shall only be entitled to claim damages up to the amount of the profit which the tort-feasor may have derived therefrom, unless it is shown that the latter caused the damage for the purpose of avoiding the redemption, or of prejudicing the party exercising such right, saving the provisions of article 1461.

- (2) Any agreement whereby the seller is to return a higher sum is null in regard to the excess.
1459. (1) The  right  of  redemption  cannot  be  reserved  for  a period exceeding five years to be reckoned from the day of the sale.
- (2) Where  the  right  of  redemption  has  been  reserved  without any limitation of time, or for a period exceeding five years, the agreement is null in regard to any time exceeding five years.
- (3) The period fixed by the contract or reduced as aforesaid, is peremptory; and it runs also against minors and persons interdicted or absent.
1460. (1) The  seller  of  an  immovable  who  has  reserved  to himself the right of redemption may exercise such right against a third party in possession even though no mention of such right shall have been made in the contract whereby such third party shall have acquired the immovable.
- (2) In  regard  to  movables,  the  right  of  redemption  cannot  be exercised if the movables have passed into the hands of a third party.
1461. (1) The  buyer  under  a  covenant  of  redemption  may exercise all the rights of his seller; he may prescribe against the true owner as well as against persons claiming to have rights or hypothecs on the thing sold; and may also set up the benefit of discussion against the creditors of his seller.
- (2) He may not, however, alter the form of the thing sold.
1462. If the buyer of an undivided portion of a tenement under a covenant of redemption becomes the owner of the whole tenement as a result of proceedings of licitation instituted against him, he may compel the seller desiring to enforce such covenant to redeem the whole tenement.
1463. If  several  persons  have  jointly  and  by  a  single  contract sold a tenement held in community, each may exercise the right of redemption in respect only of the portion which he owned.
1464. Where the person who alone has sold a tenement has left several heirs, each of them may exercise the right of redemption in respect of that portion only which he takes as heir.
1465. (1) The  buyer,  however,  in  the  cases  mentioned  in  the last two preceding articles, may, by means of a judicial act, call upon all the other sellers of the common property, or all the other co-heirs, to declare whether they too desire to exercise the right of

redemption in regard to their respective portions.

- (2) The  co-sellers  or  co-heirs  so  called  upon  shall  make  the aforesaid declaration within the time remaining for the exercise of the right of redemption, provided that if such time is less than ten days, or has entirely elapsed, such declaration shall be made within ten days to be reckoned from the service of the said judicial act.

1467. If the sale of a tenement belonging to several persons has not been made jointly and in respect of the whole tenement, but each of such persons has separately sold his portion, each seller may exercise the right of redemption separately in respect of the portion which belonged to him, and it shall not be competent to the buyer to compel the person who so exercises his right of redemption to redeem the whole tenement.
1468. (1) If  the  buyer  has  left  several  heirs,  the  right  of redemption may only be exercised against each of them in respect of his share, irrespective of whether the tenement sold is still undivided, or whether a partition thereof has already been made among the heirs.

4. ( c ) if the creditors of the assignor shall sue out a garnishee order attaching the sum due in the hands of the debtor, they  shall  be  preferred  to  the  assignee,  even  though they have become creditors only after the assignment;
5. ( d ) the  debtor  is  entitled  to  set  off  any  sum  which  may become due to  him  by  the  assignor;  but  the  assignee may not set off  the  debt  assigned  to  him  against  any sum owing by him to the debtor.
1473. The notice is not necessary if the debtor has acknowledged the assignment.

1474. Neither the notice, nor the acknowledgment referred to in the last preceding article shall be necessary in regard to bills of exchange or other documents of title transferable by endorsement or delivery.

1475. The assignment of a debt includes every security, privilege or hypothec attached to the debt and every other thing accessory to it; but it shall not include the fruits accrued due or any rescissory action, unless express mention thereof has been made in the assignment.

1476. (1) The assignor of a debt or any other right is bound to warrant its existence at the time of the assignment, although no express stipulation of warranty has been made in the assignment.

- (3) A  person  who  has  only  sold  his  claim  to  a  succession  so that the buyer may bring forward such claim at his own risk, is not bound to any warranty nor to return the price.
1482. If the seller is himself a debtor towards the inheritance or has received any property of the inheritance, he is bound to pay his debt to, or, as the case may be, indemnify the buyer: on the other hand, the buyer is bound to restore to the seller any sum which the latter may have paid in satisfaction of any debt or burden of the inheritance and to pay to the seller any claim which the latter may have against the inheritance, unless, in either case, it be otherwise stipulated.
1483. (1) Where a litigious right has been assigned, the debtor in the obligation may obtain his release from the assignee by reimbursing to him the actual price of the assignment together with the expenses and interest to be reckoned from the day of the payment of the said price by the assignee.

- (2) Exchange takes place by bare consent, in the same manner as sale.
1486. (1) The  contract  shall  not  cease  to  be  a  contract  of exchange, even though the value of the things which the parties bind themselves to give to one another has been stated or one of the parties has bound himself to give together with the thing, a supplement in money.
- (2) Nevertheless, if the sum of money which one of the parties binds himself to pay exceeds the value of the thing which such party binds himself to give, the contract shall be deemed to be a contract of purchase and sale in regard to all the things which the parties have bound themselves to give to one another.
1487. The  party  to  whom  a  supplement  in  money  is  due,  may exercise over the thing which he has given all rights and privileges competent to a seller in respect of the price, even though the contract is, under the provisions of the last preceding article, a contract of exchange.

1491. (1) A party to an exchange who has suffered the eviction of the thing which he has received in exchange, may at his option, either demand damages, or recover the thing given by him.
- (2) Where such party elects to recover the thing, he may, if the thing is an immovable, maintain an action for the recovery of the thing even against a third party in possession thereof; and he shall take it back free from any burden or hypothec with which the other party to the exchange or the third party in possession may have charged it:

Provided that in regard to any lease made in good faith and on fair conditions, the provisions of article 1530 shall apply.

1492. (1) All  expenses  of,  or  incidental  to  the  contract  of exchange shall be borne by the two contracting parties, in equal shares.

1493. Any other rule  relating  to  the  contract  of  sale  shall  also apply to a contract of exchange.

## Title VIII

## OF EMPHYTEUSIS

1494. (1) Emphyteusis is a contract whereby  one of the contracting parties grants to the other, in perpetuity or for a time, a tenement for a stated yearly rent or ground-rent which the latter binds himself to pay to the former, either in money or in kind, as an acknowledgment of the tenure.
- (2) The provisions of this Title shall apply to any emphyteusis whatsoever, even where the amount of the ground-rent shall have been fixed with reference to the value of the fruits of the tenement.
1495. Emphyteutical grants may not be made by persons who are under a disability to alienate property, unless expressly authorized to that effect by the competent authority, according to law.
1496. Notwithstanding  any  prohibition  in  the  deed  creating  the entail, possessors of tenements subject to entail may, in accordance with the provisions contained in Sub-title V of Title VIII of Part I of Book Second and in Title I of Part II of Book Second of the Code

- of  Organization  and  Civil  Procedure,  obtain  from  the  competent court authority to grant such tenements on emphyteusis, in perpetuity  or  for  a  time,  provided  the  court  is  satisfied  that  such grant is to the advantage of the persons entitled to succeed.
1497. Emphyteusis is null -
- ( a ) if not made by a public deed; or
- ( b ) if  the  grant  is  otherwise  than  in  perpetuity  or  for  a stated time to be reckoned from any certain day; or
- ( c ) if the amount of the ground-rent is not expressly stated in the contract.
1498. (1) Where  a  tenement  is  granted  for  a  time  exceeding sixteen years or in such manner that the grant may by the grantee be made to last for more than sixteen years, and, in either case, under conditions which are in accordance with the provisions of the following article of this Title rather than with those relating to contracts of letting and hiring, the grant shall be deemed to be an emphyteutical grant, although the parties shall have termed it a contract of letting and hiring; and any such grant is null if made otherwise than by a public deed.
- (2) On the contrary, where a tenement is granted under a title of emphyteusis, the grant shall be deemed to be an emphyteutical grant, notwithstanding the shortness of the period for which it is made and the nature of the stipulations attached thereto.
1499. (1) The rules contained in the foregoing articles and in articles 1501,1502, 1512, 1513 and 1519, shall be observed in all cases and any agreement contrary thereto shall be without effect.
- (2) Save as provided in sub-article (1), it shall be lawful for the contracting parties to make in a contract of emphyteusis any stipulation which they may deem proper, provided there be nothing contrary to law.

(1) Where a grant in emphyteusis is made in perpetuity, the emphyteuta, even though the ground-rent may be revised at stated intervals of time, shall have the option to redeem the groundrent as provided in the following sub-articles of this article, unless the contract itself, being a contract entered into before the 15th August, 1981, provides for a different manner in which the redemption may be effected.
- (2) Such  redemption  of  the  ground-rent  shall  be  made  by  the payment of a sum equivalent to the amount of the ground-rent capitalised at the rate of five per cent:

Provided that where the contract provides that the ground-rent may be revised at a specified time or on the happening of a specified condition, the redemption may be opted for by the emphyteuta within the first year of the date of any such revision, or the happening of such condition, and the sum payable for the redemption of the ground-rent shall, in such case, be equivalent to the amount of ground-rent so revised capitalised at the average rate of interests payable by a commercial bank on deposits of a fixed nature at the time of the redemption.

- (3) Where  there  are  more  than  one dominus ,  the  emphyteuta may redeem from one or more of them separately.
- (4) Where the tenement is held in sub-emphyteusis in perpetuity, the sub-emphyteuta shall be entitled to redeem the original ground-rent and the increase in ground-rent by the payment of the sum due for the redemption established in accordance with the provisions of this article.
- (5) Any  clause  in  any  agreement  whereby  the  emphyteuta  is deprived of the right of redeeming the ground-rent conferred by this article, shall be considered as if it has not been included in such agreement.
- (6) The redemption of the ground-rent may be effected by an agreement between the dominus and the emphyteuta made in a public deed or by means of the schedule referred to in sub-article (7) of this article.
- (7) Where  the  redemption  is  not  made  by  public  deed,  the emphyteuta may effect such redemption by filing at his expense in the registry of the competent court, a schedule of redemption and at the same time depositing in the said registry the sum due for the redemption established in accordance with the provisions of subarticle (2); and with respect to such schedule, the following provisions of this sub-article shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law contained, have effect:
6. ( a ) where the person first granting the emphyteusis or the person to whom the rights of the dominus are assigned is dead, the schedule of redemption may be served on, and the deposit may be made in favour of, one or more heirs of the dominus or his assignee, and such heir or heirs  shall,  for  all  purposes  of  law,  be  deemed  to represent  all  those  persons  having  a  legal  interest  in the  schedule  of  redemption  and  in  the  money  so

deposited;

- ( b ) the  omission  from  the  schedule  of  the  name  of  any person  having  an  interest  in  any  part  of  the  moneys deposited  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this article,  shall  not  affect  the  right  of  any  person  so omitted to any share in the amount deposited;

## ( c ) the schedule shall contain:

- (i) the  name  and  surname  of  the  person  of  the emphyteuta,  his  place  of  birth,  his  place  of residence,  his  profession,  trade  or  other  status, his  parent's  name, and  their  surname at  birth and after marriage, or in the case of a body of persons the corporate name of such body of persons and the particulars relative to its incorporation;

- (iii) the  designation  in  accordance  with  article  7  of the  Public  Registry  Act  of  the  immovable  in relation to which the ground-rent redeemed was payable;
- ( d )  the  emphyteuta  shall  attach  to  the  schedule  a  plan showing  the  extent  and  location  of  the  immovable subject to the ground-rent redeemed;
- ( e ) service  of  the  schedule  shall  be  effected  only  on  the person  named  in  such  schedule  and  if  within  three months  from  the  day  on  which  the  schedule  is  filed, service is  not  effected  on  the  person  aforesaid,  either by  reason  of  absence  or  for  any  other  reason,  the emphyteuta shall at his expense request the Registrar of Courts to have the contents of the schedule published  in  the  Gazette,  and  upon  such  publication the person on whom the schedule was due to be served shall, for all purposes of law, be deemed to be served with the schedule;
- ( f ) the emphyteuta shall cause two copies of the schedule to  be  served  on  the  Director  of  Public  Registry,  who shall keep a register of such schedules, and article 30 of  the  Public  Registry  Act  shall, mutatis  mutandis, apply to such schedules.

1502. (1) The ground-rent cannot be divided without the consent of the dominus ; but where the tenement is transferred or otherwise belongs to two or more persons separately, the dominus may not refuse his consent for the division of the ground-rent if such division is made substantially in proportion to the separate parts held by the persons requiring the consent.
- (2) The consent given by the dominus for the transfer of one or more separate parts of the tenement to different persons, or the receipt by him of one or more portions of the ground-rent, from one or more of such persons, shall have the same effect as an express consent given by the dominus for the division of the groundrent.
1503. (1) A co-possessor who has paid the entire ground-rent, obtains reimbursement from the other co-possessors pro rata having regard to the portion of the tenement held by each, notwithstanding any assignment of rights.
- (2) He contributes, in the same proportion, with the other copossessors in respect of the shares of such of the co-possessors as are insolvent.
1504. (1) The emphyteuta may alter the surface of the tenement, provided he does not thereby cause any deterioration thereof.

1505. The  emphyteuta  shall  keep,  and  in  due  time  restore  the tenement in a good state.
1506. (1) All improvements made by the emphyteuta appertain to him during the continuance of the emphyteusis.
- (2) He may alter the form of such improvements; but he may not destroy them without the express consent of the dominus.
1507. The  emphyteuta  is  bound  to  carry  out  any  obligation imposed by law on the owners of buildings or lands:

Provided that if for the carrying out of any such obligation a considerable expense is required, and the emphyteusis is for a time, the court may, upon the demand of the emphyteuta, compel the dominus to contribute a portion of such expense, regard being had to the covenants of the emphyteusis, to the remaining period of the grant, to the sum of the ground-rent and to other circumstances of the case.

1508. (1) The  emphyteuta  may,  without  giving  notice  to  the dominus or requiring his consent, dispose of the emphyteutical tenement and of the improvements, either by an act inter vivos or by any testamentary disposition.

- (2) Any alienation, however, made otherwise than by a public deed, is null.
1509. (1) Where  the  emphyteuta  makes  any  such  disposal without the consent of the dominus , he shall not be released from his obligations towards the dominus himself unless the latter acknowledges the alienee.
- (2) The  alienee,  however,  although  not  acknowledged  by  the dominus , is personally bound towards him for the payment of the whole amount of ground-rents which fall due during his tenure, and for the repair of all damages which take place during such tenure; but he is not liable for the ground-rent which fell due, or for the damages which took place previously to such tenure; saving always, even in respect of such ground-rent and damages, the rights of the dominus on the emphyteutical tenement, on the fruits and on the value of all things which serve for the furnishing or stocking or for the cultivation of the tenement, to whomsoever such things may appertain:

Provided that such rights shall not be available to the proprietor in respect of the said things if the same belong to or are held by or on behalf of any department of the Government of Malta in any case in which such department is not itself liable for the payment of the debt.

1510. The dominus may not refuse to acknowledge, in lieu of the emphyteuta, the alienee under any title, of the emphyteusis, if the alienee is a competent person to carry out the obligations arising from the emphyteutical grant.
1511. An  alienee, under any title, of an emphyteusis, in possession of the tenement, whom the dominus has acknowledged or has offered to acknowledge, may not refuse to acknowledge expressly the dominus or to bind himself personally towards him f o r   t h e   c a r r y i n g   o u t   o f   t h e   o b l i g a t i o n s   a r i s i n g   f r o m   t h e emphyteutical grant.

and where any sum due in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this article exceeds the amount of the ground-rent for one year due to that dominus in  respect of the tenement or part of the tenement sold or alienated, such dominus shall not be entitled to any such excess.

1514. The provisions of articles 1357, 1359 and 1360 shall apply to a promise made in respect of emphyteusis after the lst of July, 1976, as they apply to a promise to sell or to buy.
1515. (1) An emphyteusis is dissolved ipso jure if the tenement perishes in whole by a fortuitous event.
- (2) If  the  tenement  perishes  in  part,  and  the  remaining  part  is not capable of yielding a rent equivalent to the ground-rent, the emphyteuta may not claim a reduction of the ground-rent, but he may demand the dissolution of the emphyteusis, restoring to the dominus the tenement with the improvements even if the remaining part of the tenement consists chiefly of such improvements.
1516. It  is  incumbent  on  the  emphyteuta  to  prove  that  the tenement has perished, wholly or in part, by a fortuitous event, and without any fault on his part or on the part of his family, or of his servants, guests or tenants or of the sub-emphyteutae not acknowledged by the dominus .
1517. It shall be lawful for the dominus to  demand  the dissolution of the emphyteusis and the reversion in his favour of the tenement together with the improvements if the emphyteuta owes by way of ground-rent a sum equal in amount to three yearly payments.
1518. (1) It shall also be lawful for the dominus to demand the dissolution of the emphyteusis and the reversion in his favour of the tenement together with the improvements, in addition to the r e p a i r   o f   a n y   d a m a g e ,   i f   t h e   t e n e m e n t   h a s   c o n s i d e r a b l y deteriorated, and the emphyteuta fails to show that such deterioration has taken place without any fault on his part or on the part of the persons mentioned in article 1516.
- (2) The  same  shall  apply  where  the  deterioration  has  taken place in the improvements executed on the tenement.

not expressly bound himself to this effect.

- (3) For  the  purposes  of  this  Title  with  regard  to  an  urban, residential and commercial tenement, "structural repairs" shall be deemed to be those relating to the structure of the building itself, including the ceilings.
- (4) When the lessor in the case of a residence leased prior to the 1st June, 1995 carries out structural repairs which have become necessary not due to his own fault, then the rent shall be increased by six per cent of the costs incurred:

Provided that where the structural repairs have not become necessary due to a fault of the lessee, then the said lessee has the right to terminate the lease even though the period of the lease has not yet lapsed:

Provided  that  in  the  cases  where  the  lessor  is  willing  to carry out these repairs, the lessee may choose to carry out such repairs at his expense, and in such an event the rent shall remain unchanged; however the lessee shall in such case have no right for any full or partial compensation for such structural repairs at the termination of the lease.

1541. (1) If the lessor, on being required so to do by means of a judicial act, fails to carry out the repairs to which he is bound, it shall be competent to the lessee to request, by application, authorization to carry out such repairs at the expense of the lessor, under such conditions as the Adjudicating Panel for Private Residential Leases, the Rent Board, or the Court or the Rural Leases Control Board, as the case may be, may deem proper in the circumstances.
- (2) The lessee shall have the right to keep the rent due or the rent which is still due to be paid, so that he will be paid back for such expenses, subject to his rights for any greater amount, if the amount of those expenses is more than such rent; in this case the lessor has no right to increase the rent as mentioned in article 1540(4).
1542. The lessor is bound to make good to the lessee the damage which the latter has sustained in consequence of the delay on the part of the lessor in carrying out, on the intimation mentioned in the last preceding article, the repairs to which he is bound.
1543. It  shall  be  lawful  for  the  lessee,  without  the  necessity  of any proceedings, to carry out at the expense of the lessor the urgent repairs; and, the omission or delay of which might cause to him serious prejudice: and, in any such case, he may, for the purpose of reimbursement, retain the rent as provided in article 1541:

Provided that the lessee shall be bound to inform as soon as possible the lessor about these circumstances and to deliver to him a report by an expert as to the urgency of such repairs and their estimated value and the prejudice which might result from such delay:

Provided also that the lessor shall be entitled to assume the

continuation of the repairs commenced under the provisions of this article.

1544. If  the  repairs  which  the  lessor  is  bound  to  carry  out  are such that the omission thereof will prevent or considerably lessen the enjoyment of the thing let, and the lessor fails to carry them out within a time fixed by the Rent Board (or the court or the Rural Leases Control Board as the case may be), the lessee may also demand the dissolution of the contract, together with damages.
1545. (1) The lessor is bound to warrant the thing let against the faults or defects which prevent or diminish the use thereof; and, where the existence of such faults or defects is proved, the lessee may demand at his option either the dissolution of the contract or an abatement of the rent.
- (2) The  same  rule  shall  apply  even  though  such  faults  or defects shall have arisen after the stipulation of the contract.
- (3) The  lessor,  however,  shall  not  be  bound  in  respect  of apparent faults or defects which the lessee could have discovered for himself at the time of the contract.
1546. If, in consequence of latent faults or defects existing in the thing let at the time of the contract, the lessee suffers any damage, the lessor, if he knew of such faults or defects, or had a reasonable suspicion thereof, shall be liable in damages unless he shall have made known to the lessee the existence, or his suspicion of the existence, of such faults or defects.
1547. The  lessor  cannot,  during  the  continuance  of  the  lease, change the form of the thing let, without the consent of the lessee.
1548. (1) If, during the continuance of the lease, the tenement let requires urgent repairs which cannot be delayed until the expiration of the lease, the lessee is bound to suffer the execution of such repairs, whatever the inconvenience caused to him thereby, even though, during such execution, he may be deprived of a part of the tenement.
- (2) Nevertheless,  if  the  execution  of  such  repairs  takes  more than forty days, the rent shall be abated in proportion to the time and to the part of the tenement of which the lessee is deprived.

1548A. During the running of the lease of an urban, residential or commercial tenement, the lessor has right of access to the tenement in such times and in such manner agreed upon with the tenant in order that the lessor may fulfil his duties or to verify whether the tenant is performing his obligations, as well as to show the tenement to prospective buyers:

Provided that in the absence of an agreement between the parties, the Rent Regulation Board may, if need be, after hearing the parties summarily, fix days, times and conditions, after an application filed by the lessor for that purpose. The Board may give a decree during the sitting or in the chambers without hearing the parties. The decree shall be given within five working days from the date when the tenant is served with a notice. The Rent Board

In such case, no appeal may be made from the said decree.

1549. (1) In the case of an urban tenement  destined for habitation, if the repairs mentioned in the last preceding article are such as to render uninhabitable for any period of time that part of the tenement which is necessary for the habitation of the lessee and his family, it shall be competent to the lessee according to circumstances to demand the dissolution of the contract.
- (2) The same rule shall apply in the case of movable property if the repairs are such as to prevent the use of the thing for any period of time.
1550. The lessor is not bound to warrant the lessee against the molestations which third parties may, by mere acts, cause to him in the enjoyment of the thing let, where such third parties do not claim any right thereon, saving the right of the lessee to proceed against them in his own name.
1551. (1) Where, on the contrary, the lessee is disturbed in the enjoyment of the thing in consequence of an action touching a right on the thing let, he may maintain an action for damages against the lessor, if he is entirely deprived of the thing, or for a proportionate abatement of the rent, if he is deprived of only a part of the thing, or if a diminution of the enjoyment of the thing or an inconvenience is caused to him.
- (2) It  shall,  however,  be  competent  to  the  lessee,  even  in  the latter case, to sue for the dissolution of the contract and for damages, if the part of the thing which is left to him does not serve the purpose for which he had taken the whole thing on lease.
1552. The provisions of the last preceding article in respect of the liability for damages shall not apply -
7. ( a ) if  the  lessee  fails to give notice to the lessor, without delay, of the molestation, and the lessor is prejudiced by such omission;
8. ( b ) if  the  cause  of  the  action  referred  to  in  the  last preceding article, has only arisen after the stipulation of the contract, and is not due to an act of the lessor;
9. ( c ) if,  at  the  time  of  the  contract,  the  lessee  knew  of  the right of the third party.

1553. If the third parties who have caused molestation by mere acts claim any right on the thing let, or if an action is brought against the lessee himself to compel him to surrender the thing, in whole or in part, or to suffer the exercise of any easement, he is bound to call upon the lessor to defend him, and he shall, if he so demands, have the proceedings against him discontinued, upon declaring the name of the lessor under whom he holds the thing.

## § II. OF THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE LESSEE

## 1554. The lessee is bound -

Provided  that  when  the  tenant  does  not  remain  in  the tenement due to total dependence on the institution as certified by the same institution or as it otherwise results and there is no right of transfer of the lease as herebefore mentioned, or the transfer is not accepted by the person qualifying therefor, the lessor may request the dissolution of the contract.

- (3) In the case of commercial premises, failure to use the said t e n e ment  for  a  commercial purpose in accordance with the provisions of a contract of lease shall be deemed to be bad use of the thing leased in accordance with the provisions of article 1555.
- (4) The provisions of article 1555 shall also apply in the case of rural tenements, if the lessee abandons the cultivation thereof, or does not cultivate the said tenement as a bonus paterfamilias, and the lessor may thereby suffer prejudice in respect of which no security was given to him.
- (5) In any of the aforesaid cases, apart from those cases where the lessee forfeits the lease due to his recovery in an institution, the lessee shall also be liable to pay damages.

## § IV.OF SPECIAL RULES AS TO LEASES OF RURAL TENEMENTS YIELDING FRUITS

1577. If the lease is made for two or more years and, during the lease, there shall be lost, by any fortuitous event, the whole crop of one year or at least so much of it that the value of the remaining fruits, after deducting the value of the seeds and the expense of gathering such fruits, shall not be equivalent to one-half of the rent agreed upon, the lessee is entitled to demand, in the former case, t h e   r e m i s s i o n   o f   t h e   w h o l e   r e n t ,   a n d ,   i n   t h e   l a t t e r   c a s e ,   a n abatement of the rent, corresponding to the difference between the value of the remaining fruits and the amount of the said rent.

Remission or abatement of rent, in case of loss of crop.

1578. In  order  to  obtain  the  remission  or  abatement  aforesaid, the lessee must, during the time of the ripening of the fruits and before the gathering thereof, demand, by sworn application, that the loss be ascertained; in default of such demand he is debarred from bringing in his claim.

1579. No remission or abatement of rent shall be allowed if on striking a balance between any excess and deficiency in respect of the previous years, there remains a profit sufficient to reduce the loss sustained in the year mentioned in the demand to less than onehalf of the rent.

1580. If after striking such balance, the aforesaid loss is found to be greater than one-half of the rent, and the lease is to continue for another year or more, it shall be lawful for the court provisionally to exempt the lessee from the payment of the rent in proportion to the loss sustained.

1581. In  such  case,  however,  the  issue  of  the  remission  or abatement of rent shall not be definitely settled except at the expiration of the lease, when another balance shall be struck of any excess and deficiency in respect of the crops gathered during the whole term of the lease, and no remission or abatement shall be granted if on striking such balance there shall remain a profit sufficient to reduce the loss sustained in the year mentioned in the demand to less than one-half of the rent.

1582. If  on  striking  the  balance  as  provided  in  article  1579  no remission or abatement of rent is found to be due, it shall not be lawful for the lessee to renew the demand at the expiration of the lease notwithstanding any deficiency in the following years; saving his right to demand the remission or an abatement of the rent in respect of each of such following years if there are sufficient grounds for such demand.

1583. If,  during  the  continuance  of  the  lease,  the  lessor  has granted to the lessee the remission of the rent of one year, or an abatement thereof, in consideration of the loss sustained in such year, he may not demand the payment of the amount remitted, even though on striking a balance as provided in article 1581 it shall appear that the lessee during the years following such remission or abatement has made a profit corresponding to or even exceeding such loss, unless the lessor in granting the remission or abatement shall have reserved to himself such right.

1584. Where the time of the lease does not exceed one year, the lessee shall be equally entitled to a remission or an abatement of the rent, in the event of the happening, during such year, of the circumstances mentioned in article 1577.

1585. In no case may the lessee on account of any loss sustained recover the rent paid by him, unless in paying such rent he shall have reserved to himself such right, or unless he shall have paid the rent in advance.

1586. The lessee has no right to the remission or an abatement of the rent, if the loss of the fruits occurs after they have been separated from the soil, unless the rent shall have been made to consist in a share of the fruits in kind, in which case the lessor must bear a proportionate part of the loss, provided the lessee was not in default for delay in delivering to the lessor the latter's share of the fruits.

1587. Nor may the lessee demand the remission or an abatement of the rent, if the cause of the loss existed and was known at the time the lease was contracted.

1588. (1) The lessee  may,  by  an  express  covenant,  undertake to bear any loss caused by fortuitous events.

- (2) Any  such  covenant  shall  be  deemed  to  apply  only  to ordinary fortuitous events, such as hail, or the excessive abundance or scarcity of rain.
- (3) It shall not be deemed to extend to extraordinary fortuitous events, unless the lessee shall have undertaken to bear all fortuitous events, whether foreseen or unforeseen.

1589. The lease of a rural tenement is dissolved by the death of the lessee if it is entered into on condition that the produce shall be divided between lessor and lessee.

1597. (1) The notification of the conditions offered or agreed upon, shall be made by the lessor by means of a judicial act calling upon the person to be served therewith to declare, within the time mentioned in the last preceding article, whether he intends to accept such conditions, and warning him that, in default of acceptance within the aforesaid time, his right of preference shall lapse.

- ( e ) if  the  lessee,  during  the  preceding  lease,  was  not punctual  in  the  payment  of  the  rent  for  two  or  more terms;
- For the purposes of this paragraph, the lessee shall not be deemed  to  have  failed  to be punctual, if the payment  of  the  rent  is  not  delayed  for  more  than fifteen  days  from  the  day  on  which  the  lessor  shall have, even verbally, demanded such payment;

Provided  that  where  the  sub-lease  or  assignment  of the  lease  is  in  respect  of  a  part  of  the  tenement,  the right  of  preference  shall  cease  in  respect  of  that  part only;  but  the  lessee  shall  also  forfeit  his  right  of preference in respect of the part not sub-let or the lease whereof is not assigned, if the lessor does not wish to let the several parts of the tenement separately and the lessee  does  not  accept  the  new  lease  of  the  whole tenement on the same conditions offered by or agreed upon with others in respect of the whole tenement.

1608. The lessee may not set up his right of preference against the demand for the surrender of the tenement, where such demand i s   a d m i s s i b l e ,   i f   h e   r e f u s e s   t o   a c c e p t   t h e   n e w   l e a s e   o n   t h e conditions proposed to him and by the Rent Board deemed reasonable, even though it is proved that the plaintiff intends to let out the tenement to others on less onerous conditions.

1609. Nor  may  he  set  up  his  right  of  preference  against  the aforesaid demand, where such demand is admissible, if the plaintiff declares on oath that he does not intend to let out the tenement before the lapse of one year to be reckoned from the day of the demand, or that he does not intend to let out the tenement within the said time on conditions less onerous than those which the defendant shall have refused to accept, whatever such conditions may be, and irrespective of any opinion of the Rent Board in regard to such conditions:

Provided that if the declarant shall, in violation of the terms of any such declaration, let out the tenement, within the time aforesaid, to persons other than those mentioned in article 1606, the

party who has surrendered the tenement in consequence of such declaration, may maintain against the declarant an action for damages, exercisable within one year from the day on which the tenement shall have been so let out.

If  the  lower  part  immediately  underlies  the  parts  of  the same building, possessed or occupied by the competitors claiming the new lease, preference shall be given to the possessor or occupier whose part overlies the lower part to a greater extent; and if such upper parts overlie the lower part to the same extent, the lessor may grant the lease to any one of the competing claimants whom he prefers.

The Board shall also have the power to order the payment of rent below the said market value if it is proven to the satisfaction of the Board that the payment of the said market value would impose harsh consequences on the person managing his business from the tenement, in a way that would prejudice that person's living or that of persons working in the tenement.

shall have been requested to attend, to the number of the partners present at the meeting:

Provided  that  where  the  decision  of  the  majority  is vexatious, or contrary to the object of the partnership, or  calculated  to  give  execution  to  acts  not  naturally included in the object of the partnership, or otherwise seriously prejudicial to the interests of the partnership, it shall be lawful for the dissenting partner to demand the dissolution of the partnership, together with damages;

- ( d ) each partner may make use of the things belonging to the partnership, provided he uses them for the purpose for  which  by  custom  they  are  intended,  and  does  not use them against the interests of the partnership, or in such  a  manner  as  to  prevent  his  partners  from  using them according to their rights;

- ( d ) by  the  inhibition,  whether  general  or  special,  of  any one of the partners from entering into contracts, or by his insolvency or bankruptcy;
- ( e ) by  the  declaration  of  any  one  of  the  partners  that  he does not wish to continue the partnership.
1680. (1) Where one of the partners has promised to bring into the partnership the ownership of a thing and such thing perishes before the partnership has acquired the ownership thereof, the partnership is dissolved with respect to all the partners.
- (2) The partnership, however, is not dissolved, if the loss of the thing happens after the partnership has acquired the ownership thereof.
1681. Where one of the partners has promised to bring into the partnership the enjoyment of a thing, the loss of the thing produces the dissolution of the partnership, even though the loss happens after the partnership has commenced to enjoy the thing.
1682. (1) It may be stipulated that in case of the death of one of the partners, the partnership shall continue with his heir, or only between the surviving partners.
- (2) In the latter case, the heir of the deceased is only entitled to a partition of the partnership property having regard to the state of the partnership at the time of the partner's death, and he shall not be entitled to participate in any subsequent right, except in so far as such right is the necessary consequence of transactions made before the death of the partner from whom he inherits.
1683. The dissolution of a partnership at the will of one of the partners may only take place if the partnership is entered into for an undefined time, and it is effected by a renunciation, notice whereof

is given to all the other partners, provided such renunciation is made in good faith and not at an inopportune moment.

1684. (1) A renunciation is not in good faith, when the partner renounces for the purpose of appropriating to himself alone the profits which the partners expected to earn jointly.
- (2) It  is  made  at  an  inopportune  moment,  when  things  are  no longer in their entirety, and the interest of the partnership requires that its dissolution be postponed.
1685. Any  agreement  whereby  any  one  of  the  partners  is deprived of the power to demand the dissolution of a partnership entered into for an undefined time, is void.
1686. Nevertheless, an agreement is valid whereby the partners reserve to themselves the power to oppose the dissolution demanded by any of them, by releasing him from all his engagements towards the partnership or towards third parties, and paying to him a fixed sum, or the amount of his shares, if the partnership is divided into shares.
1687. The dissolution  of  a  partnership  entered  into  for  a  fixed time cannot be demanded before the expiration of such time, unless there be a just cause, such as when one of the partners fails to fulfil his engagements, or a habitual infirmity unfits him for the business of the partnership, or other similar causes the justness and importance of which are left to the discretion of the court.
1688. The  rules  respecting  partitions  of  common  property  are also applicable to partitions between partners, and to the effects thereof.

1695. An annuity constituted by the payment of a sum of money cannot exceed four per cent per annum on the sum paid.

- (2) It shall, however, be lawful for the creditor to stipulate that the annuity shall not be redeemed during his life, or before the lapse of a definite time which cannot exceed twenty years, in the case of land annuities, or ten years, in the case of simple annuities, to be reckoned from the date of the constitution of the annuity.
- (3) If a longer period of time is agreed upon, it shall be reduced to the one or the other of the said times, as the case may be.
- (4) When  the  creditor  is  a  foundation  or  a  trustee,  it  shall however be lawful for the parties to the contract to establish the terms for redemption of any annuity governed by Title XI of Book Second of this Code, including the fixing of the rate of redemption, the period before which it may not be redeemed, at whose option it may be redeemed and similar matters and may even prohibit such redemption by express terms.
1697. (1) The  redemption  of  a  simple  annuity  constituted  in consideration of the payment of a sum of money is effected by the reimbursement of an equal sum.
- (2) If  the  annuity  was  constituted  in  consideration  of  other movable things the value of which was stated in the contract, the redemption is effected by the reimbursement of a sum equal to such value.
1698. (1) The redemption is effected by the reimbursement of the sum resulting on capitalizing the annuity at the rate of three per cent, in case of a land annuity, or, at the rate of four per cent, in each of the following cases:
10. ( a ) in the case of a simple annuity constituted in

consideration of movable things the value of which has not been stated in the contract;

- ( b ) if  the  annuity  has been created by a will, donation or other  instrument  which  does  not  clearly  show  what was given for the constitution of the annuity.
- (2) Nevertheless,  if  the  annuity  has  been  constituted  for  the purpose of creating an ecclesiastical benefice or a sacred patrimony, or of being employed for pious uses, or for the relief of the poor, or in reward for virtue or merit, or for any other purpose of public utility, the redemption is, in every case, effected by the reimbursement of the sum resulting on capitalizing the annuity at the rate of two per cent.

Furthermore, but subject to any contrary agreement pursuant to the provisions of article 1696(4), the same rule shall apply if the annuity has been constituted for the benefit of a social purpose foundation or of a charitable trust.

1699. Saving  the  cases  expressly  stated  in  the  contract,  the debtor of a perpetual annuity may be compelled to redeem it -

- ( a ) if he fails to give to the creditor the security promised in the contract;
- ( b ) if, in the event of failure of the security given, he does not give fresh security equally sufficient;

1708. The mere default of payment of the annual sums fallen due does not entitle the grantee of the life annuity to demand the repayment of the capital, or to recover the thing alienated: he is only entitled to demand payment of the arrears, and a security for future payments.
1709. The  grantor  cannot  release  himself  from  the  payment  of the annuity by offering to reimburse the capital and by waiving all claims to the repayment of the annual sums paid by him: he is bound to pay the annuity during the whole life of the person or persons for whose life the annuity has been constituted, whatever may be the duration of the life of such person or persons, and however burdensome the payment of the annuity may have become.
1710. (1) A life annuity is due to the payee in proportion to the number of days the person for whose life the annuity was constituted, has lived.
- (2) Nevertheless, if it has been stipulated that the annuity is to be paid in advance, the whole instalment already paid in advance or which should have been so paid is acquired from the day on which the payment became due.

1711. (1) It cannot be stipulated that a life annuity shall not be subject to attachment in pursuance of a garnishee order, unless it is created under a gratuitous title, whether by an act inter vivos or by a will.
- (2) Where the annuity is so created under a gratuitous title, it may be stipulated that it cannot be alienated or sold.
1712. The payee of a life annuity cannot claim the annual sums, unless he proves the existence of the person for whose life it has been constituted.

A donation, however, of all present property or of a part of all present property, unless a contrary intention appears from the deed of donation, is presumed to have been made with the reservation of deducting therefrom, before the release or delivery of the property, the amount of the debts of the donor, existing at the time of the donation, either wholly or in proportion to the part given according as to whether the donation includes all the property or only a part thereof:

Provided that such deduction cannot be claimed after the

1773. (1) The  donee  is  bound  to  supply  maintenance  to  the donor who has become indigent, to the extent of the fruits of the thing given, provided the donee is in possession of the thing given or the value thereof and is not himself in a state of indigence.

1781. If a donation containing a stipulation of reversion is made in favour of two or more persons, the condition shall, in case of the predecease of one of such persons or of his descendants, according to the cases mentioned in article 1779, be deemed to have happened with regard to the portion of the party deceased, and the provisions of the last preceding article shall apply with regard to such portion.

- (2) In the case referred to in paragraph ( e ) of the last preceding article, the donee can claim from the donor a sum corresponding to the value of the burdens discharged or of the services rendered, whatever such value may be.

1784.

- ( c ) if,  the  donor  being  in  urgent  need  of  maintenance  or other  personal  assistance,  the  donee  has  refused  him such support as without great inconvenience to himself he could have given him.

1788. The  revocation  of  a  donation  for  ingratitude  shall  never take place ipso jure.

## OF DONATIONS IN CONTEMPLATION OF MARRIAGE

1793. Donations  of  present  property  only,  although  made  in contemplation of marriage, are, in the absence of any provision to the contrary, subject to the rules laid down in this Title relating to donations in general.
1794. Any  person  not  being  under  a  legal  disability  may,  in contemplation of a certain and determinate marriage, but before such marriage, dispose of the whole or of a part of the property which he may leave at the time of his death, in favour of the future spouses or one of them as well as in favour of the children to be born of their marriage.
1795. (1) The donation referred to in the last preceding article is irrevocable in this sense only, that the donor can no longer dispose, under a gratuitous title, of the things included in the donation, except as regards small sums by way of remuneration or otherwise, unless he has reserved to himself a more ample power of disposing.
- (2) The donor, however, shall be at liberty, up to the time of his death, to dispose under an onerous title of the things included in the donation; and any renunciation of such power is null.
1796. A donation in contemplation of a certain and determinate marriage, in favour of the future spouses or of one of them, or of their children, may be made of both present and future property, either wholly or in part, provided a description of the property and

of the debts and burdens of the donor existing at the time of the donation, is annexed to the deed of donation; in which case the donee shall be at liberty, at the time of the death of the donor, to retain for himself the property existing at the time of the donation, subject to the obligation of discharging only the debts and burdens existing at such time, renouncing his right to the remainder of the property of the donor.

1797. (1) If  the  description  mentioned  in  the  last  preceding article has not been annexed to the deed of donation of present and future property, the donee shall be bound to accept or renounce the donation in its entirety.
- (2) In  case  of  acceptance,  he  can  only  claim  the  property existing at the time of the donor's death, and shall be bound to discharge all the hereditary debts and burdens up to the value of such property.
1798. The property vesting in the donee by a donation made in terms of article 1794 or in the case mentioned in the last preceding article, shall be presumed to be sufficient for the discharge of the hereditary debts or burdens, if the donee, before taking possession of such property, has not made up an inventory in the manner provided in the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, saving always any proof to the contrary.
1799. (1) As regards the donations referred to in articles 1794 and 1796, the donee cannot, during the life of the donor, demand that the donation be carried into execution with regard to any part of the property included therein.
- (2) By any such donation, the ownership of the property shall not vest in the donee except at the death of the donor.
- (3) Nevertheless,  where  the  donation  was  made  in  terms  of article 1796 and, at the death of the donor, the donee wishes to avail himself of the power, granted to him in that article, to retain for himself the property existing at the time of the donation subject to the obligation of discharging only the debts and burdens existing at that time, the donee shall be entitled to demand the dissolution of any alienation, even if made under an onerous title, which the donor may have made of immovables included in that property, and of any hypothec or other burden with which the donor himself may have charged such immovables, provided the donation was registered in accordance with the provisions of article 996.
1800. (1) The donations referred to in articles 1794 and 1796 shall lapse, if the donor survives the donee and his descendants from the marriage in contemplation of which the donation was made.

1826. The obligations undertaken in virtue of a loan for use shall pass to the heirs of the lender and of the borrower:

Provided that if the loan is made out of regard to the borrower, and only to him personally, his heirs cannot continue to enjoy the thing lent.

1830. If the thing lent perishes by a fortuitous event from which the borrower could have preserved it by making use of his own thing instead of the thing borrowed, or if, being able to save only one of the two things, he has preferred to save his own, he is answerable for the loss of the other.

1831. A valuation of the thing, made at the time of the loan, shall have no other effect except that of determining its value at that time, in case the borrower should be answerable for any loss which may occur; and the borrower shall not, merely because the thing was appraised at the time of delivery, be answerable for any loss resulting from a fortuitous event, unless it is otherwise shown that an agreement to the contrary was made.

1832. If the thing has deteriorated merely by the use for which it was lent, and without fault of the borrower, the borrower is not answerable for such deterioration.

1833. If  in  order  to  be  able  to  make  use  of  the  thing  lent,  the borrower has incurred any expense, he cannot claim the reimbursement thereof.

1837. When the thing lent has defects that may cause injury to the person making use of it, the lender is answerable for damages, if he knew of such defects and did not warn the borrower.
1838. (1) If any question shall arise as to whether the loan of a thing is by way of a loan for use, or by way of letting and hiring, the person claiming a reward must prove his right thereto by express or tacit agreement.

1840. The borrower of a thing by way of precarium cannot delay the restitution thereof, when demanded, on the ground of any prejudice which he might sustain thereby:

Provided that if it appears that the restitution is demanded with intent to cause injury to the borrower, the court shall have power to grant him time for such restitution.

1841. Saving  the  provisions  of  the  last  two  preceding  articles, the rules laid down with regard to the contract of loan for use, shall apply to the contract of precarious loan.

1845. It may be stipulated that the restitution shall be made in a determinate species of coin; and in any such case restitution shall be made in the manner agreed upon, provided that if at the time of payment no such coins can be found or they are put out of circulation, the borrower shall be bound to return the sum to the lender in current coin, and to pay damages, if any.
1846. Where the loan is of ingots or goods, the debtor is, in all cases, bound to return the same quantity and quality, whatever may be the rise or fall in their price.

1849. No  interest  is  due  in  respect  of mutuum unless  agreed upon, saving the provisions of articles 1139 and 1140 where the borrower does not return the things borrowed at the time agreed upon, or at the time which, in the absence of an agreement, is fixed by the court.

Neither shall such an irrevocable mandate terminate on such events when they occur in relation to a mandatary who is a different person than the creditor in whose favour the mandate has been granted.

The mandatary under such an irrevocable mandate granted by way of security, shall be bound to act in a fair and reasonable manner when exercising the powers granted thereunder, provided that a mandate by way of security which is irrevocable may only be granted when the object to which it relates is property which is movable, by nature or by operation of law, and it shall not be permissible for such a mandate to be issued with reference to immovable property or rights therein.
- (2) Where powers are exercised under an irrevocable mandate granted as stated above and form part of or are granted pursuant to or in the context of a written agreement governing a broader relationship, the mandatary shall furthermore be bound to exercise such powers in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of such agreement.
- (3) Except as provided in the preceding sub-article, the appointment of a new mandatary for the same business is equivalent to a revocation of the mandate given to the previous one, even though the new mandatary does not accept the mandate.

- ( c ) if the debtor can set up a personal plea, such as those mentioned in article 1926;
- ( d ) if the debtor has become insolvent.

1936. When  the  benefit  of  discussion  has  been  admitted,  the creditor is, to the extent of the property stated in the list produced in accordance with the provisions contained in Sub-title VIII of Title II of Book Third of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, liable towards the surety for the insolvency of the principal debtor which has supervened in consequence of the creditor himself having delayed the institution or proceedings or the prosecution with due diligence of the proceedings commenced.

1937. (1) When several persons have become sureties for the same debtor and the same debt, each one shall be liable for the whole debt.

- (2) Nevertheless, each one of them may, unless he has renounced the benefit of division, or unless he has bound himself jointly and severally with the debtor, demand that the creditor should divide his action and reduce it to the share due by each surety.

1938. If, at the time when one of the sureties has obtained such division, some of them are insolvent he is liable proportionately for the shares of those who are insolvent; but no claim can be made against him in respect of the share of any other surety who becomes insolvent subsequently to the division.

1939. If  the  creditor  has himself voluntarily divided his action, he may not repudiate such division, even though there were insolvent sureties previously to the time when he consented to such division.
1940. A surety for the surety is not liable towards the creditor, except where the principal debtor and all the sureties are insolvent, or have been released consequent on some plea personal to the debtor and to the sureties.

1943. (1) He may also claim relief for interest on any sum that he has paid for the debtor, although the debt did not yield interest, as well as for damages, if any.
- (2) The  interest,  however,  which  was  not  due  to  the  creditor, does not run in favour of the surety, except from the day on which the latter shall have, by means of a judicial act, given notice to the debtor of the payment made.
1944. If the suretyship has been contracted against the will of the debtor, the surety shall not be entitled to relief against the debtor except to the extent of the advantage accruing to him.

1948. A  surety,  even  before  paying,  may  proceed  against  the debtor to be indemnified by him -

- ( a ) if he has been sued for payment;
- ( b ) if the debtor has become bankrupt or insolvent, or his condition has altered and there is a reasonable apprehension of insolvency;
- ( c ) if  the  debtor  has  undertaken  to  release  him  from  the suretyship within a specified time, and such time has elapsed;
- ( d ) if  the  debt  has  become  due  by  the  expiration  of  the time agreed upon for payment;

1957. The  merger  which  takes  place  in  the  person  of  the principal debtor and his surety, when the one becomes the heir of the other, shall not operate so as to extinguish the right of action of the creditor against the person who has become surety for the surety.

1961. Where the creditor voluntarily accepts immovable or other property in discharge of the principal debt, the surety is released, even though the creditor is afterwards evicted from such property.
1962. The mere extension of time granted by the creditor to the principal debtor does not release the surety, who may, in such case, proceed against the debtor to compel him to effect payment.
1963. The surety who has limited his obligation to the same term which was granted to the principal debtor shall continue to be bound even beyond that term, for all the time which may be necessary to compel the debtor to effect payment, provided the creditor, within two months from the expiration of such term, commences proceedings and prosecutes them with due diligence.

- (2) The  things  that  may  be  given  as  a  pledge  are  movable things and debts and other rights relating to movable things.
1965. (1) The pledge of movable things is  constituted  by  the delivery to the creditor of the thing pledged or of the document conferring the exclusive right to the disposal of the thing.
- (2) The thing pledged or the document aforesaid may also be delivered to a third party selected by the parties to the contract or placed in the custody of both parties in such a way that the party giving the pledge may not dispose of it without the co-operation of the creditor.
1966. (1) A  pledge  confers  upon  the  creditor  the  right  to obtain payment out of the thing pledged with privilege over other creditors as provided in Title XXIII.
- (2) The said privilege exists over the thing pledged only if such thing or the document relating to it has been delivered or placed in custody as provided in article 1965 and only so long as such thing or document remains in the possession of the creditor or of the third party selected by the parties or in the custody of both parties as aforesaid.
- (3) Where the thing pledged is a debt or other right in respect of which there is no such document as is referred to in article 1965, the said privilege shall not arise unless the pledge results from a public deed or a private writing, and either notice of the pledge has been given by a judicial act served on the debtor of the debt or other right or such debtor has in writing acknowledged the pledge.
- (4) Where such debt or other right results from a document, the

person giving the pledge shall, except where the document is a public deed, be bound to deliver the document to the creditor.

1967. If  the  same  debtor  contracts  another  debt  with  the  same creditor subsequently to the delivery of the thing pledged, the creditor, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, shall have, in respect of the second debt, the same rights on the thing pledged as are competent to him in respect of the prior debt, even though it has not been expressly agreed that the pledge should be made liable for the payment of the second debt.
1968. (1) Where the thing pledged is a debt, the pledgee shall be responsible for the collection of such debt on maturity, and shall place the moneys or other things received either as agreed or, failing such agreement, as the court may determine.
- (2) If  the  debt  secured  by  the  pledge  is  due,  the  pledgee  may retain, from any moneys received as aforesaid, an amount sufficient to satisfy his rights and shall deliver the remainder to the pledgor; and if the thing received is not money, he may proceed with the sale of the thing as provided in article 1970.
- (3) The creditor of a debt secured by the pledge of another debt may, at any time after his debt becomes due, demand that the debt pledged in his favour be assigned to him in payment up to the amount of his debt.
- (4) The  debtor  of  a  debt  given  in  pledge  may  oppose  to  the creditor of the debt secured thereby all the pleas which he could have set up against his own creditor; but if such debtor has himself accepted without reservation the giving of the debt in pledge, he may not oppose to the creditor of the debt so secured any compensation that may have taken place before the giving of the pledge.
1969. (1) The thing given as a pledge by a person to whom it does not belong is validly pledged, and the owner cannot recover it, except on payment of the debt in respect of which it was pledged.
- (2) This provision except as regards Il-Monti shall not apply in the following cases:
8. ( a ) when it is shown that the pledgee was in bad faith;
9. ( b ) when the thing pledged is proved to have been stolen, and the pledgor could not, presumably, have been the owner thereof.
1970. (1) The creditor, unless such creditor be Il-Monti, cannot dispose of the thing pledged in case of non-payment: but he may cause the thing to be sold by auction under the authority of the court.
- (2) The demand of the creditor for such sale may be made even by means of an application and it shall be lawful for the court upon such application to order the sale of the thing pledged, if the debtor or his lawful representative, duly served with a copy of such application with a time of three days within which to file an answer, fails to file such answer or makes no opposition to the

- (3) It shall be lawful for the court, on good cause being shown, to abridge at its discretion the times fixed in articles 256 and 312 and in the latter part of sub-article (3) of article 314 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
- (4) If the thing pledged has a stock exchange or market price, it shall be lawful for the court, on the application of the creditor, to be served upon the debtor or his lawful representative, to order that the sale of the thing pledged, even though such sale be in execution of a judgment, be carried out, instead of by auction, by means of a public broker or a bank or other banking institution to be appointed by the court.
- (5) The application referred to in the last preceding sub-article of this article may not, except where the sale of the pledge is in execution of a judgment, be made by the creditor until after the lapse of three days from the service of an intimation, calling upon the debtor or his lawful representative to pay the debt within the said time and warning him that in default of payment, proceedings will be taken for the sale of the pledge.
- (6) In no case shall the opposition of the debtor to the sale of the pledge as provided in sub-article (4) of this article operate so as to prevent or delay such sale, saving the right of the debtor to maintain an action for damages, where competent.
- (7) In  the  case  referred  to  in  sub-article  (4)  of  this  article  the court may, if the creditor is a bank or other banking institution, authorize such creditor to sell the pledge at the current price, saving the right of the debtor to maintain an action for damages, where competent.
- (8) The public broker, or the bank or other banking institution referred to in this article shall, within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the proceeds of the sale of the pledge, pay such proceeds into the court by which the sale was ordered, after deducting therefrom any expenses and commission which may be due.
1971. The debtor also may, after the debt has fallen due, or even before if the time for payment was not stipulated in favour of the creditor, demand in the manner prescribed in the last preceding article the sale of the pledge in order to pay the debt in respect of which the pledge was given.
1972. The sale of the pledge may be demanded at any time both by the debtor and by the creditor if it is shown that the thing pledged can no longer be preserved without deterioration.
1973. Any  covenant  allowing  the  creditor  to  appropriate  the thing pledged, or to dispose of it without complying with the formalities prescribed in article 1970 or depriving the creditor or the debtor of the right to demand the sale of the pledge as provided in articles 1970, 1971 and 1972 is void.
1974. The debtor remains the owner of the thing pledged until he is divested of the ownership thereof.

1975. (1) The creditor is liable for the loss or deterioration of the thing pledged resulting from his negligence.
- (2) The debtor is bound on his part to refund to the creditor any expenses which the latter may have incurred for the preservation of the pledge.
1976. The  fruits  of  the  pledge  shall  be  deemed  to  form  a  part thereof, and shall be subject to all the rights of the creditor as the pledge itself.
1977. (1) If  the  thing  pledged  bears  interest  or  yields  other profits, the creditor shall appropriate such interest or profits to the interest which may be due to him.
- (2) If the debt in security of which the pledge was given does not bear interest, the appropriation shall be made to the principal of the debt.
- (3) Any  covenant  contrary  to  the  provision  of  this  article  is null.
1978. In case of abuse of the pledge on the part of the creditor, the debtor may demand that the thing pledged be deposited with a third party, in order to safeguard the rights of the creditor and of the debtor.
1979. The  debtor  cannot  claim  the  restitution  of  the  thing pledged until he has wholly paid the principal, interest and expenses of the debt for which the pledge is liable.

1980. The creditor may, with the consent of the debtor, make use of the pledge, saving the provisions of article 1977 in case the creditor should derive an advantage therefrom.

1981. The use of the thing pledged made by the creditor without the consent of the debtor shall be deemed to be an abuse thereof, and the creditor shall be liable to the consequences mentioned in article 1978, and shall, moreover, be bound to make the appropriation referred to in article 1977, if he has derived any advantage from such use.
1982. The  creditor  who  with  the  consent  of  the  debtor  subpledges the thing which he holds by way of pledge shall continue to be liable for any loss of or injury to the thing pledged, which is caused by negligence, as well as for the restitution of the pledge at the time when such restitution is due.
1983. The creditor  who  without  the  consent  of  the  debtor  subpledges the thing which he holds by way of pledge, shall be liable also for any loss or injury caused by a fortuitous event, where the thing pledged would not have been lost or injured if it had remained in the possession of the creditor.
1984. If  the  person  to  whom  the  thing  has  been  given  by  the creditor by way of sub-pledge, makes use thereof, the provisions of articles 1980 and 1981 shall apply in favour of the debtor who had given such thing to the creditor by way of pledge.

## Title XXII

## OF ANTICHRESIS

1987. (1) Antichresis is a contract whereby a creditor acquires the right to collect the fruits of an immovable belonging to his debtor, subject to his obligation of deducting annually such fruits from the interest if any be due to him, and then from the principal of the debt.

- (2) Antichresis can only be created by virtue of a writing.
- (3) Any antichresis  created  by  virtue  of  a  public  deed  before the 28th February, 1961, for a period exceeding thirty years, is deemed to be a sale, provided the said public deed is enrolled in the Public Registry as a transfer by title of sale.
- (4) The enrolment referred  to  in  sub-article  (3)  of  this  article may be made at any time by the creditor or by any person deriving title from the creditor.
1988. (1) The creditor  is  bound,  unless  it  has  been  otherwise agreed, to pay the ground-rent and other burdens to which the immovable which he holds in antichresis is subject.
- (2) He must also provide for the maintenance and the necessary repairs of the immovable.
- (3) All the expenses for the above purposes shall be deducted from the fruits.
1989. (1) The debtor cannot, before he has wholly satisfied his debt, resume the enjoyment of the immovable which he has given by way of antichresis.
- (2) Nevertheless,  the  creditor  who  wishes  to  release  himself from the obligations mentioned in the last preceding article, can always compel the debtor to resume the enjoyment of the immovable, unless he has renounced such right.
1990. (1) The  creditor  does  not  become  the  owner  of  the immovable by the mere default of payment at the time agreed upon;

and any agreement to the contrary is void.

- (2) In  default  of  payment,  he  may  sue  for  the  sale  of  the immovable by judicial auction according to the provisions of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
1991. The contracting parties may stipulate that the fruits be set off against the interest, in whole or in part, even though the interest agreed upon may thus be exceeded, provided the interest shall not thereby exceed the rate of eight per cent per annum.
1992. (1) Antichresis  may  be  given  by  a  third  party  for  the debtor.
- (2) The provisions of articles 1979 and 1985 shall also apply to antichresis.

- (2) If the creditor  who  holds  the  immovable  by  way  of antichresis, enjoys, independently of such antichresis, any right of privilege or hypothec lawfully created on such immovable, he may exercise such right of privilege or hypothec in the order competent to him and as any other creditor.

## Title XXIII

## OF PRIVILEGES AND OF HYPOTHECS

1994. Whosoever  has  bound  himself  personally,  is  obliged  to fulfil his obligations with all his property, present and future.

1995. (1) The property of a debtor is the common guarantee of his creditors, all of whom have an equal right over such property, unless there exist between them lawful causes of preference or there shall have been a transfer of any property by way of security or a transfer under a security trust for such purpose in accordance with this Code.
- (2) Property is lawfully transferred by way of security, if made in accordance with article 2095E or articles 2095F to 2095I and such transfer shall not be subject to re-characterisation as any other contract.
- (3) Creditors  of  the  transferor  may  impeach  any  transfer  by way of security as aforesaid if the transfer is made in fraud of their rights. For the purposes of article 1144 such transfers shall be considered to be onerous and in case of a security trust, the creditor must prove fraud on the part of both the transferor and the transferee but it shall be sufficient if he proves fraud either on the part of the security trustee or on the part of the beneficiary whose interest is being secured thereby.

2062. (1) Besides  in  the  case  mentioned  in  article  2027,  the reduction of a registration may be ordered by a judgment in the case of a general legal hypothec, or of a judicial hypothec, if it is shown that the registration can be restricted as to the property affected thereby without injuring the interests of the creditor.

2072. (1) If the third party in possession fails to surrender the immovable or movable or to pay the debt fallen due, it shall be lawful for the hypothecary creditor to demand judicially the sale of the immovable or movable charged with the hypothec after having by means of a protest called upon the debtor to discharge the debt, and upon the third party in possession either to discharge the debt or to surrender the immovable or movable.
- (2) The said demand may not be made before the expiration of thirty days from the service of the protest on the debtor and the third party in possession.
2073. A third party in possession who is not personally liable for the debt may, by setting up the benefit of discussion, oppose the sale of the immovable or movable of which he is in possession, if there is in the possession of the debtor or of his sureties or of other

2077. The  surrender  of  the  immovable  or  of  the  movable  until the sale thereof has taken place, shall not prevent the third party in possession from taking back the immovable or the movable on paying the whole debt and the costs, even though the surrender may have taken place in execution of a judgment.
2078. The surrender of the immovable or of the movable shall be made by means of an act filed before the competent court.

2081. (1) The easements and real rights which a third party in possession had upon the immovable before he came into possession thereof, shall revive after the surrender made by him or after the adjudication which has taken place against him.

2089. Debts  having  a  general  privilege  for  any  of  the  causes mentioned in paragraphs ( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) of article 2003 are paid in preference to those having any other privilege, excepting only the debt due to the pledgee as provided in paragraph ( a ) of article 2009.

2090. Debts  having  a  general  privilege  for  any  of  the  causes mentioned in paragraphs ( d ) and ( e ) of article 2003 are paid in preference to those having any other privilege, excepting the debts mentioned in paragraphs ( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) of the said article, the debt due to the pledgee as aforesaid, and the debt due to the hotel-keeper as provided in paragraph ( b ) of article 2009.

2091. (1) Saving  the  provisions  of  the  last  two  preceding articles, in all cases of competition of privileged debts, differing in degree, the order in which the privileges are set forth in articles 2003, 2009 and 2010 shall determine their respective priority.
- (2) Nevertheless,  the  privilege  of  the  seller,  mentioned  in paragraph ( d ) of article 2009, shall not operate to the prejudice of t he  privilege of the dominus o r   o f   t h e   l e s s o r,   m e n t i o n e d   i n paragraph ( e ) of the said article; the right of the seller mentioned in article 1439 shall not operate to the prejudice of the debts mentioned in paragraphs ( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) of article 2009; and the debt mentioned in paragraph ( b ) of article 2010, if it is in respect of necessary repairs for the preservation of the tenement, shall have preference over the debt due to the dominus .

2094. Privileged or hypothecary debts in the same rank, are paid ratably.

2095. (1) In the same rank in which a debt is placed, there shall be placed also the interest accruing on that debt, the expenses of registration, and the expenses, if any, incurred for the judicial acknowledgment of the debt unless the latter are otherwise privileged:

For the purposes of article 2042 and other provisions under special laws which may be applicable to security, the trustee shall be treated as a creditor and shall be entitled to be registered as holder of the security, indicating his position as trustee.

- (2) The  security  trustee  shall  enjoy  all  such  rights  and  be subject to such obligations as may be stated in the instrument in writing regulating -
2. ( a ) the appointment of the security trustee, and
3. ( b ) the  security  granted  to  the  security  trustee  for  the benefit of the creditor or creditors.
- (3) Security, for the purposes of this article,  means  any arrangement whereby the rights of a creditor are legally protected including any undertaking, guarantee, mandate, pledge, title, transfer, grant, privilege or hypothec or the placing of property in possession or control of the trustee with rights of retention and sale as may be agreed.
- (4) When a hypothec is created in favour of a security trustee which is a bank or other entity which is authorised in terms of the Banking Act or in terms of equivalent legislation overseas, such hypothec may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be granted to secure future debts by the same debtor to the security trustee or the beneficiaries of the security trusts, present or future,

as may be defined in the trust instrument. Such a hypothec shall be valid on condition that the deed constituting the hypothec expressly states that it secures future debts of the same debtor and limits the effects of the hypothec to a stated maximum sum. Such information shall form part of the relative note of registration for the purposes of article 2042 in lieu of the requirements of article 2042( c ), ( d ) and ( e ).

3. ( a ) the  trustee  is  not  the  creditor  of  the  principal  debt  or obligation; or
4. ( b ) all creditors enjoy the right to sue, jointly and severally, for the enforcement of the debt:

Provided that payment by the debtor either to the security trustee or to the beneficiaries, if also creditors, shall discharge the obligations of the debtor to the extent of the payment made.

- (7) Subject to the preceding sub-article, nothing in the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure shall hinder the action of a security trustee for the benefit of the beneficiaries under a trust on the basis of any simultaneous judicial or other action by any beneficiary under the trust.

- (9) A  security  trustee  may  resign,  retire  or  be  substituted  in accordance with the terms of the trust and in such case the original security trustee shall assign any security held by him to the substitute security trustee in the form required by law for the particular security held.
- (10) Beneficiaries of a security trust who may be vested with the debt, may assign the debt to third parties and the provisions of article 1475 shall apply to the security for such debt even when held by a security trustee and in such case the assignees of such debt shall enjoy the rights of beneficiaries under the security trust upon notice to or acknowledgement by the trustee without the need of a separate assignment of the beneficiary rights under the trust deed.
- (11) The appointment of a security trustee to hold security, his removal or his substitution by another trustee and any related transactions shall not operate as a novation nor shall they affect the security validly constituted in any manner.
- (12) A security trustee may also act as an agent or mandatory for the beneficiaries of the security trust and may carry out functions under such contract in accordance with its terms.

4. ( a ) in the case of debts and rights against an obligor, when notice is given in accordance with the article 1471 or the obligor of the assigned right has acknowledged the assignment; or
5. ( b ) in the case where the rights consist of property, where there  is  no  obligor  and  where  the  title  to  which  is registered in a public registry, the effects of  the transfer  shall  arise  when  the  transfer  is  registered  in the relevant register.

For the purposes of article 1471, notice in writing may be given by any means, including by electronic means, and it shall not be required that notice be made by judicial act.

- (8) Apart from the case contemplated in article 1472( b ), when a further assignment of a debt or other right is made by way of security and is notified to the debtor or registered in accordance with sub-article (7), the effects of the subsequent assignment shall

Enforcement of rights. Added by: VIII.2010.61.

arise only on the termination of the effects of the prior assignment and the rights of the subsequent assignee are conditional thereon. Except where the subsequent assignment is made with the written consent of the prior assignee and subject to the terms of such consent, the prior assignee shall have no obligations towards any subsequent assignee.

- (9) The consideration for a transfer by way of security shall be the grant and acceptance of security, and the provisions of Title VI of Part II of Book Second as to "price" shall not apply to such transfers.
- (10) For  all  effects  and  purposes,  the  creditor  to  whom  the property has been transferred shall be considered to be the absolute owner of the property so transferred and such property shall not form part of the patrimony of the debtor.
- (11) A transfer  made  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this title:
4. ( a ) shall not be subject to re-characterisation as any other contract  and  shall  take  effect  in  accordance  with  its terms; and
5. ( b ) shall be enforceable in accordance with the terms of an agreement made in accordance with sub-article (2) and the provisions of this title notwithstanding the bankruptcy or insolvency of the debtor of the debt or the grantor of security by title transfer or the commencement  or  continuation  of  any  insolvency  or winding up proceedings or re-organisation measures.

property as security for the performance of the secured obligations,

- ( b ) of applying such property or its value in settlement of the secured obligations in case of default; and
- ( c ) of  returning  the  property,  or  its  equivalent  in  case  of fungible property, on performance  of the  secured obligations or of returning any excess in value to the transferor in case of enforcement,

and notwithstanding the obligation to avoid conflicts of interest he shall be entitled to act in his own interests for the above purposes.

- (4) Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  creditor  is  the  absolute owner of property transferred by way of security, any exercise of ownership rights other than as may be provided for in the agreement between the parties or as herein provided shall be a breach of fiduciary duties for which the creditor shall be liable toward the debtor in accordance with this Code.
- (5) When enforcement is through set-off by the creditor, upon notice of enforcement given in accordance with article 2095G(2), the creditor shall become the absolute owner of the property and shall be released of all fiduciary duties arising from the transfer agreement and these provisions.

- ( b ) in the case referred to in sub-article (6), the proceeds of sale received by the creditor shall be set-off against the secured obligations,

and any excess shall be immediately paid over to the transferor.

- (8) If  it  is  necessary  to  properly  realise  the  commercially reasonable value, the creditor shall be entitled to sell or set-off as aforesaid all the property transferred by way of security even if it exceeds the value of the secured obligations. Otherwise, the creditor shall only sell or set-off as much as is required to cover the secured obligations, interest and charges and return the excess property to the transferor.

4. 2095I. (1) When the debtor has performed the secured obligations the creditor is bound absolutely to return the property to the transferor by carrying out such formal and others acts as may be required.
- (2) Except  as  otherwise  agreed,  it  shall  not  be  lawful  for  the transferor to demand the partial return of the property transferred by way of security on the partial fulfilment of the secured obligations and the creditor is only obliged to return the property so transferred to the transferor, when the debtor has fully performed the secured obligations.
- (3) The  terms  of  any  undertaking  relating  to  the  return  of property transferred in accordance with this Title shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms and the provisions of article 1357 shall not apply.
7. 2095J. (1) Nothing in this Title shall limit or affect the application of the laws of Malta which may implement the Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive (2002/47/EC), as the same may from time to time be amended, in so far as it applies to particular property which may be the subject of a title transfer

2097. The  effect  of  the  aforesaid  benefit  in  favour  of  those entitled to it is only that of protecting them against any prejudice which they might sustain in regard to the property of the inheritance in consequence of the claims of the particular creditors of the heir; and such benefit maintains in favour of all and each of them, in competition, such rights only as are competent to them respectively, according to the nature and the conditions of their debts or other rights over the property of the inheritance.

2098. The  right  to  exercise  the  said  benefit  ceases  unless  it  is exercised within one year from the day of the opening of the succession.

2099. Any alienation of hereditary property, whether movable or immovable, made by the heir, even during the course of the said time, before such benefit is exercised, shall remain unimpaired; but in any such case the benefit may be exercised over the price which may be still due.

- (2) Immovables, however, alienated after the benefit aforesaid has been exercised, continue to be subject to the rights of the

creditors of the deceased and to those of his legatees.

2101. (1) The said benefit is exercised by means of a judicial demand.
- (2) As  regards  immovables,  however,  the  registration  of  the benefit takes the place of such demand.
2102. (1) For  the  purpose  of  effecting  the  registration  of  the benefit of the separation of estates, there shall be presented to the Director of the Public Registry a note containing -
4. ( a ) the particulars set forth in paragraphs ( a ), ( b ), ( c ), ( d ), ( e ) and ( f ) of article 2042;
5. ( b ) a  demand  for  the  registration  of  the  benefit  of  the separation  of  the  estate  of  the  deceased  debtor  from that of his heirs.
- (2) The provisions of articles 2043 to 2047 and 2049 to 2052 shall apply to the registration of this benefit.
2103. The  registration  of  the  aforesaid  benefit  effected  within three months of the day of the opening of the succession shall be operative as from such day in regard to immovables alienated within the said time.
2104. (1) The  benefit  of  the  separation  of  estates  cannot  be exercised if there has been novation by acknowledging the heir as the debtor.
- (2) The benefit shall not operate except in favour of the persons exercising it.
- (3) It may be exercised in regard to all the property indiscriminately or for the separation of one or more things specified in the demand.
2105. The creditors of the heir cannot demand the separation of estates against the creditors of the inheritance.
2106. The  benefit  of  the  separation  of  estates  in  regard  to successions opened before the 11th February, 1870 shall continue to be regulated by the laws in force at the time of the opening of such successions.

2132. (1) The interruption of prescription made by means of a judicial demand shall be deemed inoperative if the plaintiff withdraws the action or if the action is deserted, or dismissed.
- (2) With regard to the withdrawal or the dismissal of an action, the provisions of this article shall not apply in cases where the plaintiff can, according to law, re-institute the action, provided such action is so re-instituted before the same or another court within one month from the day of its previous withdrawal or dismissal, and service thereof is effected in the manner and within the times established in the two preceding articles, as the case may be.

## TITLE II

## OF LEGAL PERSONALITY

## Sub-Title I

## Of Legal Persons

3. (1) Legal  persons  are  organisations  endowed  with  legal personality. Legal personality is acquired through the formal recognition of the State. Recognition by the State requires a specific act of recognition and no other administrative act of the State in relation to an organisation or activity shall constitute recognition. Except where legal personality is recognised or established by a law or an international treaty or agreement or is granted in virtue of registration pursuant to any special law, legal personality shall only be acquired by an organisation on its registration with the Registrar for Legal Persons in accordance with article 12.
2. (2)When organisations are created by voluntary act, they shall be established in accordance with such legal forms as the law provides for.
3. (3)An organisation shall only be recognised as a legal person if it

complies with such formalities as are applicable to the legal form selected for its establishment and registration.

(4)Organisations created by voluntary act, whether registered or not, are primarily governed by the laws applicable to their particular legal form or to their purpose or category and, where the provisions of special laws or provisions of other parts of this Code do not provide on any matter provided for in this Title, also by the provisions of this Schedule.

- (5)Organisations which do not enjoy legal personality shall only have such rights and powers as are granted to them by or in pursuance of the express provisions of law.
4. (1) Every  legal  person  has  a  patrimony  which  shall  be appropriated to a purpose or purposes in accordance with article 1.

(2)Every  legal  person  must  be  identifiable  by  a  unique  name which is assigned to it on the date on which it is constituted, and under which it exercises rights and performs its obligations. Such name may be changed following the procedure established by law. Any name must conform to law and include, where required, a denomination that clearly indicates the legal form assumed by the legal person.

- (3)Every  legal  person  shall  have  an  address  in  Malta  where communications can be received and information requested about its activities.
- (4)Legal  persons  act  through  their  organs,  such  as  a  board  of administrators, directors or trustees and, to the extent that they have members the general meeting of members on matters designated to such organ.
- (5)Legal  and  judicial  representation  of  a  legal  person  shall  be vested:
- ( a ) in all cases, in any one or more of the administrators, jointly  and  severally,  in  the  manner  stated  in  the statute or the applicable law;
- ( b ) without  limiting  the  powers  of  representation  of  the administrators  as  stated  in  paragraph  (a),  in  other persons as are named in the statute of the organisation or other holders of office therein designated; and
- ( c ) the administrators;

shall be deemed to enjoy the power to delegate such powers of representation by means of a written resolution or written power of attorney in favour of any third parties. The administrators of a legal person bind it to the extent of the powers vested in them by law, the statute and any bye-laws or as otherwise stated in the law applicable to their particular legal form:

Provided that any limitation in the powers of the administrators shall not be relied upon as against third parties in good faith irrespective of whether such limitation, published or not, arises from the statute or from any internal decision, unless it is proved that such third party was aware that the act was in breach of the

General rules applicable to legal persons. Amended by: XXXVI.2018.44.

limitation.

Provided further that in the absence of any statement on the legal representation of any organisation in the statute, the sole administrator, or if there are more than one, any two administrators, shall have the legal representation of the organisation in accordance with this sub-article.

(6)Every legal person shall have at least one administrator who may act on its behalf or have such minimum number of administrators as may be required by the law applicable to its legal form, purpose or category.

- (7)Any person acting in the name of a legal person which does not exist shall be bound personally to perform the obligations undertaken, and except as otherwise stated in any special law, a legal person may ratify any act done in its name before it was registered. Upon ratification the legal person is bound by the obligations entered into by the person who acted in its name and shall be entitled to all rights. The ratification shall not constitute a novation unless the other party to the transaction expressly releases the person acting in the name of the legal person from the obligations assumed by it:

Provided  that  a  person  acting  for  a  legal  person  before  it  is constituted shall not be bound personally if the contract stipulates otherwise or includes a statement to the effect that the agreement is conditional upon the legal person coming into existence or that the legal person might not be constituted or may not assume the obligations undertaken in the contract.

Provided further that notwithstanding the provisions of this subarticle, where a third party deals in good faith with persons acting in the name or on behalf of a legal person before its establishment, any contract would come into effect from the date on which the organisation shall come into existence, and the organisation shall be entitled to be indemnified by the persons who had acted in its name or on its behalf with respect to its liability under this subarticle towards the said third party.

(8)Legal persons may not exercise tutorship or curatorship to a person. They may, however, to the extent that they are authorised by law to act as such, hold office as trustee or curator of property. They may also act as a liquidator or executor of a will, an official consignee, a judicial sequestrator, a trustee or an administrator of another legal person.

(9)Legal persons may be the beneficiaries of dispositions under wills as well as donations subject to the following provisions:

- ( a ) testamentary  dispositions  in  favour  of  unregistered organisations  shall  not  come  into  effect,  and  to  the extent  performed  shall  be  revocable  on  demand  by application to the Court of any person interested in the will  unless  an  application  for  the  registration  of  such organisation  is  made  in  terms  of  the  applicable  law within  one  year  from  the  day  of  the  opening  of succession;

- ( b ) donations made to an organisation shall be deemed to be made on the assumption that it is registered or will be registered and shall not come into effect, and to the extent  performed  shall  be  revocable  on  demand  by application to the Court of the donor, unless an application for the registration of such organisation is made  in  terms  of  the  applicable  law  within  one  year from the donation;
- ( c ) the  administrators  who  have  been  informed  of  their engagement  and  accept  the  same  shall  effect  such registration within the period above stated; and
- ( d ) the  Court  shall  have  the  power  to  extend  such  time limit  on  application  of  any  administrator  or  other interested party or to order the administrator or any other relevant  person  to  register  the  organisation  and  do  all such acts as may be necessary to ensure that the intent of the testator or donor, as the case may be, is achieved at its discretion.
- (10)The provisions of sub-article (9) shall not apply to testamentary dispositions and donations in favour of pious foundations, marriage legacies and ecclesiastical entities.
- (11)Legal personality may not be set up against a person in good faith in order to perpetrate fraud.
5. (1) A  legal  person  exists  in  perpetuity  unless  otherwise provided by law or its statute, constitutive instrument or public deed.
- (2)Legal persons constituted directly by or in terms of a special law exist from the date of the coming into force of the law or from the date prescribed therein. In other cases, legal persons exist from the date of registration or from such other date provided for in the laws that are applicable to their particular legal form.
- (3)Legal  persons  cease  to  exist  with  effect  from  the  date  when they are struck off from the relevant register in accordance with the laws applicable to their particular legal form or as stated in any special law.
- (4)Without prejudice to the rules applicable to legal persons of a particular legal form, on the application to the Court of any interested person or the Registrar, the Court may, failing the taking of such relevant actions by the legal person or its officers according to the applicable law, order the striking off from the register of the legal person in the following cases:
- ( a ) when  the persons vested with such authority so determine  in  accordance  with  the  statute,  constitutive instrument or public deed; or
- ( b ) upon  the  happening  of  the  events  expressly  stated  to have such effect -
- (i) in the constitutive instrument or statute; or
- (ii) in  the  laws  that  are  applicable  to  its  particular legal form; or

- ( d ) when there is no administrator in office or the number of  administrators  falls  below  the  minimum  required  by law for a particular legal form for a period exceeding six months; or
- ( e ) when the number of members falls below that required by this Schedule in the case of an association or when there are no beneficiaries in the case of a beneficiary foundation.

- ( a ) such  continuing  status  is  subject  to  registration  in terms of this Schedule or any special law, or is required in a notice issued by the Minister and published in the Gazette and registration is not effected within the time provided  for  in  such  notice,  in  which  case  they  shall cease  to  be  recognised  as  legal  persons  with  effect from the lapse of such date, or
- ( b ) they otherwise cease to exist according to law.

- (4)Religious organisations and marriage legacies which are constituted as foundations shall not be bound to register and shall continue to be recognised as legal persons until they are wound up.

- ( a ) have  full  legal  capacity  and  all  the  powers  of  a registered  legal  person  as  stated  in  this  Schedule  and the restrictions in article 14 shall not apply to it;
- ( b ) continue to be the exclusive owner of all its property even if acquired after the lapse of the period referred to  in  sub-article  (2)  and  shall  be  liable  for  its  own obligations;

- ( c ) until it is registered in accordance with this Schedule, the liability of its administrators shall be governed by the provisions of article 17 and other provisions applicable  to  unregistered  organisations  for  all  acts carried out from the lapse of the period stated in subarticle (2) until the date of registration but the administrators  shall  not  be  in  any  way  liable  for obligations  entered  into  by  the  existing  foundation prior to such date unless they have personally assumed such obligations in writing; and
- ( d ) when it is registered, the provisions of article 16 shall thereafter  apply  to  all  acts  of  the  administrators  after the date of registration.

- ( b ) be subject to the restriction in article 14(5);

( b )direct  otherwise  than  as  provided  in  paragraph  (a)  so  as  to ensure the effective achievement of the initial purposes of the organisation.

(14)In making an order referred to in the preceding sub-article, the Court shall ensure that neither the purposes of the organisation nor any vested rights of any person shall be affected, nor shall any obligations other than those freely undertaken by any person arise from such modification or reorganisation.

(15)It shall not be lawful to register a hybrid organisation under this Schedule and the Registrar shall require compliance with subarticle (9) prior to accepting the registration thereof.

- (3)Where an organisation may acquire legal personality through registration in a public registry under any other law applicable to its form, it shall not be lawful to register such an organisation in terms of this Sub-Title.
- (4)Except for public organisations and other organisations which are already registered in a public registry and have legal personality as a result thereof, the enrolment of an organisation with or the issue of a certificate or licence by the State which, in terms of any applicable law, grants legal personality to the organisation shall be interpreted as requiring, as an additional condition thereof, the registration of such organisation in terms of this Schedule.
- (5)It shall be a condition for registration of any organisation the administrator or administrators of which are not ordinarily resident in Malta, to appoint and retain at all times, a person who is ordinarily resident in Malta to act as local representative and such representative shall have, by operation of the law and without the need of any act on the part of the administrators:
- ( a ) the legal representation of such organisation in Malta and this for all purposes of any law in Malta; and
- ( b ) the legal representation of such organisation limitedly to  the  signing  of  forms  and  other  notifications  to  the Registrar and other competent authorities in Malta and the  enrolment  of  instruments  and  other  documents executed by the administrators with a Notary Public in Malta when  necessary to comply with the legal obligations of the organisation in Malta:

Provided  that  if  the  administrators  appoint  another  person  or persons to carry out the acts stated in paragraphs (a) and (b), the local representative shall only act in consultation with such persons when such person or persons are not in Malta or if they fail to carry out any such function when required to do so within the times stated in this Schedule.

For the purpose of this sub-article, residence shall be established by documentary evidence.

(6)A certificate of registration given in respect of an organisation is conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Schedule in respect of registration and of matters precedent and incidental to it have been complied with and that the organisation is duly registered in terms of this Schedule.

(7)The provisions of this Schedule regulating the registration and filing of documents and notes of registration in the Register of Legal Persons shall apply to the registration and filing of acts by all registered legal organisations governed by this Schedule and the provisions of any other law regulating the filing and registration of documents in a public registry shall not apply except where expressly stated.

## Of Unregistered Organisations

13. (1) An unregistered organisation is an organisation having a form recognised by law, which is constituted by an instrument in writing and which, being registerable in terms of this Schedule or any other special law, is not so registered.
2. (2)The instrument in writing establishing an unregistered organisation shall contain, on pain of nullity, an express statement of a specific purpose or purposes for which the organisation has been established.
3. (3)Without prejudice to the right of association of any person and the right of any person to establish an organisation, an association of persons or the appropriation of property to a purpose which is not in written form is not recognised for the purposes of this Schedule.
4. (4)The following organisations shall not be treated as unregistered organisations for the purposes of this Schedule although they are not registered with the Registrar for Legal Persons:
5. ( a ) any organisation which is already registered pursuant to  a  special  law  regulating  its  form  resulting  in  legal personality;
6. ( b ) public organisations, except those public organisations which  have  been  established  in  a  legal  form  which requires registration, if they are not registered;
7. ( c ) foreign  and  international  organisations  not  obliged  to register in Malta; and

each of which shall be regulated by any special law applicable to their particular form.

14. (1) Saving as otherwise stated in this Schedule, unregistered organisations are not legal persons but, pursuant to this Sub-Title, they enjoy recognition, as a matter of fact, and legal powers to achieve the stated purposes for which they are constituted.
2. (2)An  unregistered  organisation  may  enter  into  transactions  in relation to movable or immovable and other registerable property, may open bank accounts and may engage persons and contractors to provide services it may require for the achievement of the express purposes of the organisation and all ancillary matters.
3. (3)An  unregistered  organisation  may  enter  into  contracts  in  its own name.
4. (4)An  unregistered  organisation  may  be  sued  in  its  own  name and is represented in legal proceedings by any administrator. An unregistered organisation may sue in its own name and is represented by the person who, in terms of the statute, enjoys such power or in the absence of such appointment, by the sole

administrator or, if there is more than one, by any two administrators.

- (5)An unregistered  organisation  may  establish  other  organisations provided the other organisations are registered.
15. (1) The  internal  management  and  administration  of  an unregistered organisation is regulated by its statute. Legal representation of the organisation shall be vested in the person who, in terms of the statute, enjoys such power or, in the absence of such appointment, by the sole administrator or, if there is more than one, by any two administrators.

(2)The  contributions  of  the  promoters  and  assets  acquired  by such contributions constitute the patrimony of the unregistered organisation. Any obligations undertaken by the unregistered organisation may be enforced against such patrimony without prejudice to the liability of other persons for such obligations.

- (3)Any  property  acquired  by  any  means  by  an  unregistered organisation shall be considered to be held by or for the following interests as the case may be where it is established:
- ( a ) as  a  private  benefit  organisation,  unless  otherwise stated in its statute or in any written instrument signed by the promoters and authenticated by a Notary Public, such  property  shall  be  considered  to  be  held  for  the promoter in ownership or the promoters in coownership according to the proportion of their contribution to the unregistered organisation;
- ( b ) partly  for  a  private  benefit  and  partly  for  a  social  or other  public  purpose,  unless  otherwise  stated  in  its statute  or  in  any  written  instrument  signed  by  the promoters and authenticated by a Notary Public, such property  shall  be  considered  to  be  held  in  ownership for  the  private  benefit  subject  to  the  performance,  by the  promoters or administrators, as fiduciaries, of the social or other public purpose, until the said purpose is achieved, exhausted or becomes  impossible or is otherwise addressed by the appropriation or endowment  of  a  sufficient  part  of  the  property  to  a registered  public  benefit  organisation  with  a  similar purpose;
- ( c ) solely  for  a  social  or  other  public  purpose,  or  in  the case  of  religious  organisations  and  marriage  legacies and  public  organisations  in  the  form  of  foundations, religious or public purposes respectively, such property shall be held by the promoters or administrators as fiduciaries only for  the  purpose stated in the statute or any special law which may be applicable to it.

(4)On dissolution of an unregistered organisation which is:

- ( a ) established as a public benefit organisation, the property of the organisation must be applied in accordance with article 32;

Management and property rights in unregistered organ- isations. Amended by: XXXVI.2018.54.

- ( b ) established as a private benefit organisation, the property  shall  be  distributed  in  accordance  with  the express  terms  of  the  statute,  failing  of  which,  to  the promoters or their heirs:

Provided that any person with a co-ownership right in property of an unregistered organisation may only demand the division of such patrimony and any promoter or administrator may only dissolve the organisation and, or withdraw his contribution from an unregistered organisation when all obligations towards third parties have been performed and, or its purposes have been achieved, exhausted or become impossible.

## Sub-Title VIII

## Miscellaneous

20. (1) It  shall  be  lawful  for  a  registered  organisation  to establish segregated cells within the organisation to achieve particular purposes with particular assets. Where the special law applicable to a particular legal form of registered organisation already provides for segregated cells, or equivalent features, such provisions shall apply to the exclusion of the provisions of this article.

Cap. 492

- (2)A segregated cell within a registered organisation exists when established formally:
- ( a ) by  the  statute  of  the  organisation  on  creation  of  the organisation; or
- ( b ) subsequently  by  a  resolution  of  the  administrators pursuant to a power vested in them by the statute and in either case shall be established:
- (i) by reference to shares, interests or other rights of the members or beneficiaries or by reference to purposes, or by reference to both such rights and purposes; or
- (ii) for purely administrative purposes which support the main purposes and operations of the organisation; and
- (iii) with  other  purposes  which  shall  be  consistent with the main purposes of the organisation.
- (3) Segregated  cells  may  be  established, except for  those established for purely administrative reasons:
- ( a ) in the case of a public benefit organisation, only to the extent  as  they  are  established  exclusively  for  public benefit on a non-profit making basis, or other legitimate purpose excluding private interest  and  may  include public interest beneficiaries; and
- ( b )  in  the  case  of  a  private  interest  foundation,  for  private purposes including any commercial, administrative, security  or  transactional  purposes,  including  purposes ancillary thereto, in particular those referred to in article 31B of this Schedule.
- (4) When the segregated cell is established by the statute of the organisation, the administrators shall be presumed to have the power to supplement such statute with additional guidelines on the purposes and activities of the cell in a manner which supports the purposes and objects of the organisation.
- (5) Segregated  cells  shall,  after  establishment,  be  regulated either in the statute of the organisation and, or in a cell statute. A cell statute shall be consistent with the statute of the organisation. The statute of the organisation shall apply on any issue which is not addressed in the cell statute and shall prevail over the cell statute in case of inconsistency.

## (6) A cell statute shall:

- ( a ) state the following matters:
- (i) the name of the cell;
- (ii) the purposes or objects of the cell;
- (iii) the  manner  in  which  the  administrators  shall manage its affairs, directly or through an administrative  committee,  which  shall  in  any

case not have legal representation of the cell;

- ( b ) be  in  the  form  of  a  resolution  or  guideline  of  the administrators;
- ( c ) in  case  of  a  cell  for  beneficiaries,  either  state  the names of the beneficiaries or the class of beneficiaries or, in the absence of such indication, a declaration that the cell is constituted for the benefit of beneficiaries. In the latter case the beneficiaries shall be indicated in a written instrument, which need not form part of the cell  statute,  called  a  "cell  beneficiary  statement"  and which  shall  be  signed  by  the  administrators  in  the presence of a notary public, and all provisions in the Schedule relating to beneficiary statements shall apply mutatis mutandis to cell beneficiary statements; and
- ( d ) comply with the requirements of this article.
- (7)A segregated cell shall have its own distinct name or designation and it shall refer to the organisation of which it forms part in all its dealings, but shall not be a legal person nor shall it be eligible for registration as a legal person. A cell may not change its name or designation under any circumstances.
- (8)A segregated cell is established subsequently to the creation of an organisation when the following conditions are observed:
- ( a ) the organisation is authorised by its statute to establish segregated cells;
- ( b ) the administrators of the organisation resolve in writing to establish such cell; and
- ( c ) a  notice  relating  to  the  establishment  of  a  segregated cell is delivered to the Registrar for registration.

(9When a segregated cell is established -

- ( a ) the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  cell  shall  constitute  a distinct  patrimony  which  shall  be  distinct  from  all other assets and liabilities of the organisation or other cells which may be established;
- ( b ) the assets  of  such  cell  shall  be  available  for  the fulfilment of any obligations undertaken by the organisation  in  relation  to  that  cell  but  not  for  any other  liabilities  entered  into  by  the  organisation  for itself or in respect of other cells;
- ( c ) the  general  assets  of  an  organisation  shall  not  be available for the fulfilment of the obligations undertaken in relation to the cell; and
- ( d ) there shall be implied (except in so far as the same is expressly  excluded  in  writing)  in  every  transaction entered  into  by  an  organisation  with  segregated  cells the following terms that -
- (i) no party shall seek, whether in any proceedings or  by  any  other  means  whatsoever,  to  make  or attempt to use any assets attributable to any cell

- to satisfy a liability not attributable to that cell; and
- (ii) if  any  party succeeds by any means whatsoever in  using  any  assets  attributable  to  any  cell  to satisfy a liability not attributable to that cell, that party shall be liable to pay to the organisation a sum  equal  to  the  value  of  the  benefit  thereby obtained by him; and
- (iii) any asset  or  sum  recovered  by  the  organisation under the implied term set out in this paragraph or by any other means whatsoever in the events referred  to  herein  shall,  after  the  deduction  or payment of any costs of recovery, be applied by the  organisation  so  as  to  compensate  the  cell affected.
- (10)When a segregated cell is established the assets of the cell must be segregated from all other assets of the organisation and are held and administered separately and distinct accounts must be maintained in accordance with applicable law in relation to each cell. The existence or termination of each cell must be disclosed in the reports and accounts of the organisation.
- (11)The legal effects stated in sub-article (10) shall arise only if -
- ( a ) all activities relating to a cell shall be undertaken in a manner  that  it  is  expressly  disclosed  to  third  parties that the activities are those in respect of the particular cell:
- Provided  that  such  requirement  shall  be  satisfied  if third  parties  are  otherwise  aware  or  ought,  from  the circumstances, to be aware of the fact that the activities undertaken are those in respect of the particular cell;
- ( b ) no statement or representation is made by the administrators of the organisation to the effect that the organisation is liable for the obligations undertaken in respect of the cell;
- ( c ) the  cell  is  established  in  accordance  with  this  article and all relative procedures and formalities are observed at all times.
- (12)When the conditions in sub-article (7) are satisfied, no court shall order the issue of any warrant, precautionary or executive, against the assets of a cell in respect of a claim for which the organisation or another cell is liable. In the event of enforcement on any assets attributable to a cell in respect of a liability not attributable to that cell,  and  in  so  far  as  such  assets  or compensation in respect thereof cannot otherwise be restored to the cell affected, the organisation shall -
- ( a ) cause or procure its auditor, acting as expert and not as arbitrator, to certify the value of the assets lost by the cell affected; and
- ( b ) transfer or pay to the cell affected, from the assets to

which  the liability was  attributable to the extent available,  assets  or  sums  sufficient  to  restore  to  the cell affected the value of the assets lost.

- (13) The rules, including without limitation the rules applicable to dissolution and winding up, applicable to the legal form of an organisation within which a cell is established shall apply mutatis mutandis to  the cell as though the cell were itself a registered organisation of the same legal form with such modifications as are necessary to accommodate the fact that the cell is not a legal person.
2. (14)The winding up of a cell, whether voluntarily or due to its inability to perform its obligations shall not affect the continuing operation of the organisation which established it or other cells in any manner whatsoever and the appointment of a liquidator for a cell shall not affect the powers of the administrators in relation to the organisation or any other cells. Where a cell is being wound up and a liquidator is appointed, the powers of the administrators of the organisation shall cease and shall vest in the liquidator, solely in respect of that cell.
3. (15)Any  winding  up  proceedings  in  relation  to  an  organisation within which cells are established shall respect the legal status of each cell as a patrimony separate from the assets and liabilities of the organisation and other cells of the organisation and from the assets and liabilities of the organisation not attributable to any cell.
4. (16)A  cell  shall  be  administered  by  the  administrators  of  the organisation who may, if authorised by the statute, establish an administrative committee with reference to one or more cells, and the administrators may delegate any of their powers to such administrative committee or committees as the case may be. Such delegation shall:
5. ( a ) not in any way restrict the powers of the administrators  of  the  organisation  in  relation  to  the cell; and
6. ( b ) not  include  the  legal  and  judicial  representation  in relation to the assets and liabilities of the cell.
7. (17)The  provisions  of  fiscal  law  which  apply  to  legal  persons shall mutatis mutandis apply to a cell as though the cell were itself a registered organisation of the same legal form of the organisation within which the cell is established.
8. (18)The  Minister  may  make  regulations  to  regulate  segregated cells, in general or for particular legal forms of organisations, and to regulate any matters related,

## including:

- ( a ) any formalities which shall be necessary for a cell to be created by  the appropriation  of assets  already belonging to the organisation to the cell;
- ( b ) the dissolution of cells;
- ( c ) the transfer of assets of a cell to another organisation, with or without segregated cells;

- ( d ) the legal effects of such transfers; and
- ( e ) all matters related and incidental thereto.

(19)The  Minister  may  also  make  regulations  to  regulate  the establishment of segregated cells having legal personality.

- 20A. (1)   It  shall  be  lawful  for  the  cell  of  one  organisation, hereinafter referred to as the "transferring organisation", to be transferred to another organisation, hereinafter referred to as the "recipient organisation" where:
- ( a ) the  administrators  of  the  transferring  organisation  so resolve in writing pursuant to a power vested in them by the statute;
- ( b ) the creditors of the cell in the transferring organisation do not object to this transfer following public notice of at least thirty (30) days of the intent to transfer;
- ( c ) the recipient organisation has the same legal form and is  of  the  same  purpose  or  category  as  that  of  the transferring organisation;
- ( d ) the administrators of the recipient organisation resolve in  writing  to  accept  such  cell  pursuant  to  a  power vested in them by the statute;
- ( e ) a notice relating to the transfer of the cell is delivered to the Registrar by the administrators of the recipient organisation and the Registrar shall:
- (i) record  the  notice  of  transfer  of  the  cell  in  the records of the transferring organisation; and
- (ii) issue a new certificate relating to the transfer of such cell and record such transfer in the records of the recipient organisation; and
- ( f ) it  is  required,  under  a  special  law,  to  obtain  the approval or consent of any regulatory or governmental authority for such action, that such consent or approval is obtained.
- (2)The  assets  and  liabilities  of  a  cell  shall  constitute  a  distinct patrimony which shall be distinct from all other assets and liabilities of the recipient organisation or other cells of such organisation, if any.
- (3)The  transfer  of  a  cell  shall  not  entitle  the  creditors  of  the recipient organisation to have recourse to the assets of the transferred cell or of the transferring organisation.
- (4)All  rights  and  obligations  of  the  organisation  and  any  third parties shall cease to be those of the transferring organisation with respect to the cell and shall continue unaffected as rights and obligations of the recipient organisation with respect to the cell by operation of law with effect from the date of notification to the Registrar in terms of sub-article (1)(e), notwithstanding the absence of any agreements or consents that would otherwise be necessary for the transfer to be effective in law for those purposes.
- (5)Upon the completion of the transfer, the administrators of the

recipient organisation shall notify in writing all interested parties of which they are aware regarding the transfer of such cell from the transferring organisation to the recipient organisation providing details of its name and purpose and other material information.

- (6)When  a cell is transferred it shall retain its name  or designation notwithstanding the transfer of the cell in accordance with this article but the administrators of the recipient organisation may enter into a unilateral declaration by public deed and register this event in the applicable public register.
- (7)The  transfer  of  a  cell  as  contemplated  in  this  article  shall constitute a change in fiduciary and shall be governed by the provisions of article 1124C(4) of the Code regulating the succession of fiduciary obligations.
- 20B. (1)   It  shall  be  lawful  for  a  cell  of  an  organisation  to  be constituted as a new organisation, with all the assets and liabilities of the cell becoming the patrimony of the new organisation or a part thereof.
- (2)The  name  of  the  new  organisation  shall  reflect  the  name  or designation of the cell as closely as possible to comply with the applicable law in this regard.
- (3)Such  action  may  be  taken  under  such  conditions  as  may  be applicable by the administrators of the existing organisation by means of a resolution of the board of administrators only if the statute of the organisation provides for such power.
- (4)The cell shall be constituted as a new organisation upon the observance by the administrators of the requirements applicable to the creation of a new organisation of the same legal form as the organisation in which the cell is currently established, including its registration with the Registrar, and if the cell is created with reference to members, the members shall sign the statute of the new organisation, and:
- ( a ) the administrators in office shall be the administrators of the new organisation unless new administrators are appointed in the constitutive documents when a cell is being constituted as a new organisation;

- ( a ) the transfer of a cell from the transferring organisation to the recipient organisation; or
- ( b ) the constitution of a cell into a new organisation,

and, upon good cause being shown that such transfer should not take effect,  the  Court  shall  either  accede  to  the  creditor's  demand, authorise  the  aforementioned  transfer  or  constitution  on  sufficient security being given or give such other orders as it  deems appropriate.

- 20E. For  the  purposes  of  the  notifications  contemplated  by article 20A and 20B it shall be sufficient if the administrators publish the relative notices as follows:
- ( a ) if the organisation has creditors in Malta, in two daily newspapers  published  in  Malta,  one  in  Maltese  and one in English; or
- ( b ) in the case of an organisation which does not have its principal creditors in Malta, in two general distribution newspapers,  one  published  in  Malta  in  the  English language and one published in the country where the principal creditors of the organisation carry out business in the language of the place of business.

The legal person shall be struck off from the register in which it is registered subject to the conditions as may be laid down by regulations.
- (5)The conversion of a legal person into another form or into a trust shall not operate to prejudice any creditor or third party in any manner whatsoever.

- (iii) "pious  or  religious  purposes"  are  understood  to be  those  which  concern  acts  of  piety,  of  the apostolate,  or  of  charity,  whether  spiritual  or temporal  and  include  similar  organisations  of any religious denomination;
- ( b ) any  reference  to  "ecclesiastical entity" shall  be  a reference to an association of persons or a universality of  things  which  are  established  by  the  competent ecclesiastical  or  other  religious  authority  so  that  they might, in the name of such authority and in accordance with  the  provisions  of  the  relevant  law,  fulfil  the specific  task  entrusted  to  them  in  view  of  the  public good,  including  the  imparting  of  religious  teaching, the  promoting  of  public  worship  and  the  undertaking of projects which are appropriate to their character and governed by their statutes,  under the higher direction of  the  said  authority.  Such  entities  include  dioceses, parishes  and  all  institutes  of  consecrated  life  and societies of apostolic life, and include similar organisations of any religious denomination.

(1) An association is an agreement between three or more persons to establish an organisation with defined aims or purposes to be achieved through the dedication of efforts and resources by such persons and others who may join voluntarily, the patrimony, namely assets and liabilities, if any, of the association being distinct from that of the members, its administratorsor any beneficiaries:

Provided  that  an  association  which  is  not  established  as  a public benefit organisation may be established between two persons.

- (2)Associations are not bound to register as legal persons but are entitled to do so.

Religious organisations constituted as foundations or associations and established for purposes as defined in applicable religious laws shall not be subject to or in any manner regulated by this Schedule and shall be regulated by the relative religious laws. In the event that they are registered as foundations or associations under this Schedule they shall also be regulated by the provisions of this Schedule from such date and in case of inconsistency the provisions of this Schedule shall prevail.

(3)When the property endowed is not cash or any other asset, the value of which appears on the face of it, the administrators shall declare, in a statement which shall be attached to the application form for registration, that in their considered opinion the property endowed upon or vested in the foundation has a value of at least the amount required by this article:

- an  indication  of  the  category  of  the  foundation  in  the statute;
- ( d ) the constitutive assets with which it is formed;
- ( e ) (i) the composition of the board of administration and the name, surname, identification, passport or registration number,  as  applicable, nationality  and residential  address  of  the  administrators,  if  any,  or when  there are no administrators at the time of establishment  or  registration,  the  person  who  has  the power to appoint the administrators;
- (ii) the manner in which administrators are appointed  and  removed  from  office  and  the duration of their appointment, if any:
- Provided that if the duration of the appointment of the administrators is not stated in the deed of foundation, administrators shall be deemed to have been appointed indefinitely until they retire or are removed.
- ( f ) the  term  for  which  it  is  established,  if  any  and  if  not stated  it  shall  be  presumed  to  be  established  for  an indefinite  term  except  in  a  beneficiary  foundation  in which case the provisions of articles 29(7) and 33 shall apply;

Such beneficiaries  may  be indicated  in  a  written  instrument,  which  need  not  form part of the public deed, called the "beneficiary statement",  signed  by  the  founder  and  addressed  to  the administrators,  and  the  same  shall  be  signed  in  the presence  of  a  Notary  Public.  The  use  of  a  beneficiary statement shall not be permitted in the case of a beneficiary  foundation,  or  a  cell  of  such  a  foundation, when it is established exclusively for the benefit of public interest beneficiaries.
- ( i ) where there exist more than one board or committee in virtue of the deed of foundation, the deed of foundation  shall  specify  which  board  or  committee shall be the board of administration;
- ( j ) when the category of any foundation is for the public benefit,  this  shall  be  stated  expressly  through  the  use of  the  words  "public  benefit",  "social  purpose"  or "public purpose" in the constitutive instrument and in

the statute of the foundation.

- (5) The  statute  shall  be  signed  by  the  founders  and  any person subscribing to the statute after a foundation is established by means of a public deed or in such other manner provided for in the statute shall be deemed to have consented to all the provisions of the statute and all rules which may have been validly promulgated by the foundation until such date.
2. Where a foundation is being established as a public benefit foundation involving more than three persons as promoters,  the  signature  of  three  persons  shall  be sufficient to indicate the consent of all founders at the time of establishment. A document containing a list of all founders shall be sufficient evidence of their consent.  The  Notary  Public  shall  not  be  bound  to ascertain  that  the  three  persons  have  been  authorised by the founders to appear on the deed but shall rely on the  document  submitted  to  him  by  the  three  persons containing  a  list  of  all  founders  as  evidence  of  their consent.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,  in  respect  of  the  persons  listed  in  the  document containing the list of all founders, their name, surname and  identity  card,  passport  number  or  registration number, as applicable, shall suffice:

The  document  shall be attached to the public deed establishing the foundation:

Provided  further  that  any  person  named  as  a  founder  in  a document as referred to above who claims that he did not authorise the three persons to include his name and surname and identity card, passport number or registration number, as applicable, in the document shall, within sixty (60) days of his becoming aware of his inclusion in the document, be entitled to register a declaration to that effect in the Register of the foundation and in the absence of any written evidence to the contrary which may be produced in case of dispute on such matter, he shall not be considered ever to have been a founder.

(6)When  administrators  are  designated  in  the  statute,  unless  they consent on the said statute itself, the written consent of the administrators must be delivered to the Registrar prior to registration of any foundation. When the administrators are not designated in the statute, their written consent must be submitted to the Registrar on the notification of their appointment.

(7)( a )  It  shall  not  be  lawful  to  state  a  term  for  a  foundation  in excess of one hundred and twenty-five (125) years except in the following cases in which a foundation may have an unlimited duration:

- (i) public benefit foundations; or
- (ii) foundations governed by article 31B(4), (5) and (6).
- ( b ) When no term is specified in the deed of a foundation, a  foundation  shall  be  considered  to  be  valid  for  one hundred and twenty five (125) years from its establishment except in the cases referred to in paragraph (a).
- ( c ) Saving  as  otherwise  provided,  in  the  event  that  a longer term  is stated in a  deed  of a  beneficiary foundation,  it  shall  terminate  on  the  hundred  and twenty  fifth anniversary  from  when  it  came  into existence.  The  limitation  on  duration  also  applies  in the case where a foundation results from the conversion  of  another  registered  organisation  or  of  a trust in accordance with this Schedule and any regulations  or  from  the  transfer  of  a  patrimony  by  a foundation  to  another  foundation  or  trust.  In  such  a case periods of existence shall be considered cumulative.
- (8)Article 1753(1) of this Code shall not apply to endowments in favour of registered foundations.
- (9)Foundations established in accordance with this Schedule are not prohibited by articles 331, 757 to 761 and 1776 of this Code.
- (10)Article  586  of  this  Code  shall  not  affect  any  term  of  a foundation because it relates to the inheritance of the founder or because the provisions relating to property belonging to the foundation are to take effect after the death of the founder.
- (11) ( a ) The provisions of this Schedule shall apply to dispositions in wills in favour of foundations, whether such foundations are created i n t e r   v i v o s or by testamentary disposition, and this notwithstanding the provisions of articles 688, 693 and 695 and other similar provisions of the Civil Code.
- ( b ) The administrators of a foundation may not renounce to a benefit to the foundation under a will pursuant to a disposition in its favour except with the prior consent of the beneficiaries or in the case of a purpose foundation, the Court:
- Provided  that  nothing  in  this  sub-article  shall  oblige  any administrator to accept a benefit under a will or an endowment if such administrator has reason to suspect that the same consists of assets derived from any criminal offence or involves money laundering or the funding of terrorism:

Provided  further  that  if  the  administrator  is  not  willing  to accept to act as an administrator or to continue in such office, the provisions of article 35 shall apply.

(12)The  provisions  of  this  Title  shall  apply  to  all  foundations existing on the coming into force of this provision but existing foundations will not be obliged to comply with the requirements in sub-article (2) and shall comply with the requirements of subarticle (3) only upon registration. Nothing in this Schedule shall render invalid anything done prior to the coming into force of this law which was valid when done.

hereinafter referred to as "rules of mandatory  application" or "mandatory  rules"  which  cannot  be  derogated  from  by  a  voluntary act,  such  laws  shall  prevail  over  the  terms  of  the  foundation  and related  endowments  unless  otherwise  expressly  provided  in  this Schedule or in applicable law.

(2)To the extent that there exist rules of mandatory application, t h e   c o u r t s   s h a l l   a p p l y   s u c h   m a n d a t o r y   r u l e s   s u b j e c t   t o   t h e provisions of article 29B.

(3)When  a  foundation  is  governed  by  Maltese  law  and  has  no connection to Malta by reason of the domicile of the founder at the time of the endowment of the property to the foundation or the situs of the property, when immovable, any rules of mandatory application shall not apply in any manner. In such cases no regard shall be had to:

Mandatory rules to prevail. Added by: XXXVI.2018.70.

Management of inconsistent provisions. Added by: XXXVI.2018.70.

- ( a ) the domicile, habitual residence, registration, authorisation  or  place  of  business  in  Malta  of  any protector or any person rendering administration, accounting or other services to the foundation; or

- ( c ) the situs of property in Malta, when movable; or
- ( d ) the  fact  that  the  place  of  execution  of  the  deed  of foundation,  any  documents  relating  to  the  foundation or relating to the foundation property or other transaction documents is Malta.

(4)In  the  case  of  a  foreign  foundation,  the  rules  of  mandatory application shall only apply to any relevant endowment to the foundation when the founder is domiciled in Malta at the time of creation of the foundation or the making of the endowment, subject always to the rules stated in article 29B.

- (5)In the case of a foreign foundation, when the founder of such a foundation is not domiciled in Malta at the time of the creation of the foundation or the making of the endowment, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply only in so far as they regulate the continuation or otherwise in Malta of the foundation or the endowment.
- (6)To the extent that there exist rules of mandatory application in the law applicable in the circumstances in terms of Maltese private international law, the courts of Malta may apply such mandatory rules subject to the provisions of article 29B.
- (7)When a court is  requested  to  recognise  a  foreign  judgement which enforces any rules of mandatory application as referred to in sub-article (6), the court may accede to such request subject to the provisions of article 29B.
- 29B .  In  order  to  ensure  that  the  provisions  of  applicable  law which cannot be derogated from by voluntary act are applied in a manner which preserves the endowment to the foundation and its terms as far as possible, the following rules shall apply:
- ( a ) the application of the mandatory rules shall not produce the failure or invalidity of the endowment or the  foundation,  and  where  possible,  the  endowment and the foundation shall continue under the same terms in  relation  to  property  which  is  unaffected  by  such mandatory laws. Subject to any order of the court, the affected  property  shall  be  held  by  the  foundation  for the founder absolutely, or if he is dead, for his heirs;
- ( b ) the administrators shall be empowered to:
- (i) vary  the  terms  of  the  foundation  in  so  far  as relates  to  the  nature  or  the  extent  of  benefit  or the endowment; or

- Provided that the beneficiaries or the purpose of the foundation derive the benefits in accordance with the  intentions  expressed  by  the  founder  in the  deed  of  foundation  in  a  manner  compatible with the mandatory rules and any property which becomes  free  from  the  terms  of  the  foundation for  any  reason  shall  be  held  by  the  foundation for  the  founder  absolutely,  or  if  he  is  dead,  for his heirs;
- ( c ) for  the  purposes  of  resolving  conflicts  between  the endowment  and  the  foundation  and  any  mandatory rules and to enable the continuance of the foundation as specified in paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ), the terms of the foundation  or  the  endowment,  where  silent,  shall  be deemed to include:
- (i) the  power,  without  any  obligation  to  do  so,  of the administrator to reduce the foundation assets and return all or part of them to the founder or the estate of the founder so as to achieve compliance with such provisions of law;
- (ii) the  power  of  the  administrator  to  enter  into arbitration  and  mediation  agreements  and  to reach  a  compromise  to  disputes  and  claims  by third parties; and
- (iii) the  power  to  seek  directions  from  the  Court  on such matters:
- Provided further that such powers shall be exercisable notwithstanding any contrary provisions  of  the  deed  of  foundation  or  the endowment and, provided the administrator acts honestly, in good faith and reasonably, such acts shall  not  constitute  a  breach  of  any  fiduciary duties and any applicable law;
- ( d ) the  property  of  the  founder  which  is  not  endowed  to the  foundation  shall  first  be  utilised,  to  the  extent possible, to meet the claims of any person seeking to invalidate or reduce an endowment;
- ( e ) notwithstanding any other applicable law, the foundation may meet a valid claim being made against the  foundation  property,  whether  voluntarily  or  as  a result  of  a  court  direction,  order  or  judgement,  by  a payment of value in money and shall not be obliged to return property endowed to the foundation in kind;
- ( f ) any person who succeeds in reducing the property of the foundation or obtains a court order to invalidate an endowment  in  whole  or  in  part  or  who  enjoys  the benefits  of  an  arrangement  with  the  foundation  as provided in paragraph (c)(i), shall forfeit the benefits under the foundation, unless the terms of the

Provided  that,  the  fact  that  the  Registrar  registers  a foundation  in  the  absence  of  compliance  with  any requirement  under  any  special  law,  shall  not  exempt such foundation or its administrators from their obligation to comply with such law or to be subject to any penalties or proceedings which may arise from the breach of such special law.

31B . (1)  Private  interest  foundations  may  carry  out  the  trading activities referred to in:

- ( a ) this sub-article and sub-articles (2) and (3); and

Provided  that  private  foundations  may  also  establish another legal organisation to carry out acts of trade or trading activities to achieve and promote their principal purposes and objectives. They may establish another legal organisation to carry out any acts of trade which  are  not  related  to  their  principal  purposes  and objectives  only  when  this  power  is  expressly  granted in their statute.

For  the  purpose  of  this  article,  a  private  interest  foundation means  a  foundation,  which  neither  qualifies  as  a  public  benefit foundation  nor  is  it  established  for  a  public  or  social  purpose  and which is not a voluntary or non profit organisation but which can be established for a legitimate purpose and any reference to a foundation in terms of this article shall be construed as a reference to a private interest foundation.

- (2)Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  sub-article  (1),  a  private interest foundation:
- ( a ) may have additional objectives and powers contained in its statute to enable it to carry out any such activities referred to in this article to achieve its purposes or to protect  its  assets  and,  or  to  otherwise  comply  with legal requirements; and
- ( b ) shall, in any case, be deemed to have all the powers to do anything which is necessary or ancillary to achieve the said purposes.

- ( b ) the  carrying  out  of  acts  of  trade  of  any  kind  by  the delegate with assets belonging to the foundation shall not imply that the foundation is itself carrying out such activities.

For the purpose of this sub-article "passive" shall mean that the foundation is not involved in the day to day operations of the relevant activity  but  shall  not  imply  limitations  on  the  foundation  or  its administrators from exercising or protecting the rights of the foundation in relation to any of its purposes or assets.

- (5)Subject to any authorisations, registrations or notifications as may be necessary under applicable laws, a foundation may operate:
- ( a ) as  a  collective  investment  vehicle,  and  issue  units  to investors therein, for the holding of a common pool of assets, the management of which is delegated to a third party;

- ( d ) as a retirement scheme or fund;
- ( e ) for  the  holding,  administration,  development,  or  sale of undivided property originating from an inheritance deriving from one or more deceased person or persons common to the beneficiaries for the sole purpose of the division or liquidation of the common estate;

- ( f ) to issue tokens and carry out any trading activity resulting from such foundations owning, administering or otherwise operating an innovative technology arrangement, as defined in the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act; or
- ( g ) for any other purpose as may be prescribed in a notice issued by the Minister under this Schedule.

(6)A  foundation  may  be  used  in  the  context  of  the  following transactions and any transactions connected or ancillary thereto:

- ( a ) securities offerings, whether  to the public or for private placement, portfolio management and custody of investment instruments;
- ( b ) the grant of real or personal security interests, including  hypothecs,  mortgages,  privileges,  pledges and guarantees;
- ( c ) collective  loan  agreements  and  other  multi-creditor banking facilities;
- ( d ) insurance policies and the payment of proceeds thereunder;
- ( e ) timeshare and multi-property structure; and
- (f) such other commercial transactions as may be prescribed in a notice issued by the Minister under this Schedule.

(7)When  a  foundation  is  established  with  segregated  cells,  the foundation may itself render services against remuneration in favour of any of its cells which are established for the benefit of beneficiaries or for purposes or both.

(8)Whenever the activities of a foundation intended to be carried out under sub-articles (4), (5) and (6) are subject to laws regulating credit or financial institutions, insurance undertakings, investment services or funds, trusts and trustees, corporate or other licensable fiduciary institutions, such foundation shall only be permitted to register with the prior written consent of the Malta Financial Services Authority, where applicable in terms of law and when it is the competent authority under such law, or may be permitted by such authority to register but not to carry out activities, until it is authorised by means of a notice issued by such authority.

(9)Where such activities are exempt from registration in terms of sub-article (8), the Registrar for Legal Persons may request confirmation of such exempt status from the Malta Financial Services Authority prior to registering the foundation in terms of the provisions of this Schedule.

(10)Nothing  in  this  article  shall  prohibit  foundations  regulated by European Union law from carrying out acts of trade or trading activities if they are permitted to do so under such law.

- (i) the founder, if it is also a public benefit organisation, irrespective of its purpose; or
- (ii) if  sub-paragraph  (i)  does  not  apply,  another public  benefit  organisation  with  the  same  or similar  purposes  but  the  recipient  shall  make reasonable efforts to achieve the original purposes of the endowments made to the original organisation:
- Provided that when the purposes are the advancement of religion or the carrying out of a religious vocation or there are indications in the original endowment that this was intended for a religious  organisation,  to  any  pious  foundation or  ecclesiastical  entity,  and  in  such  case  of  the appropriate denomination; or

(8)When the dominant purpose of a foundation is to support a class of persons which constitute a sector within the community as a whole, because they suffer from a particular social, physical or mental disability it shall be permissible to indicate one or more individuals who suffer from such condition as named beneficiaries. Notwithstanding such indication, the foundation shall be considered to be a public benefit purpose foundation on condition that after the death of such beneficiaries, the residual property of the foundation is, by the express terms of the statute, to be held either for the exclusive benefit of the designated class of beneficiaries or for another foundation established for a similar social purpose which qualifies as a public benefit.

- (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of this article and other provisions of this Schedule, a "purpose foundation" which is not established as a public benefit foundation shall be subject to the provisions of Column A with the modifications in Column B which prevail over its legal form in deference to its non-public benefit purposes:

Amended by: L.N. 426 of 2012; XXXVI.2018.76; XXV.2019 .28; XXXIX.2020.22.

(3)The benefit under a foundation is personal to the beneficiary and subject to any applicable laws and only as stated in the terms of t he  foundation, creditors, spouses, heirs or legatees of the beneficiary may have rights only to the extent of the beneficiary's entitlements under the foundation and have no other rights in relation to the assets of the foundation.

Provided that no decision of a founder shall affect the validity of anything lawfully done by the administrators prior to such decision, before they receive notice of such amendment, nor shall it affect or interrupt lawful acts in progress or lawful commitments made and not yet fulfilled by the administrators.

- (8)A beneficiary may be appointed -
- ( a ) subject to a condition; or
- ( b ) for a specified time; or
- ( c ) up to a specified value of benefit,

as a founder shall deem appropriate:

Provided that, if the founder is deceased, a beneficiary may apply to the Court requesting it to eliminate any condition or requirement which is considered to be unreasonable paying regard to all the

circumstances:

Provided further that persons unworthy of receiving under a will cannot receive as beneficiaries under a foundation.

(9)The terms of the foundation may provide for the addition of a person as a beneficiary or the exclusion of a beneficiary from benefit at the discretion of the administrators.

- (11)Where  the  benefit  consists  in  an  annuity  or  pension  or  the use and enjoyment of property and the enjoyment of fruits therefrom, the terms of the foundation may make the interests of the beneficiary -
- ( a ) subject to restriction on alienation or dealing;
- ( b ) not liable to attachment under a garnishee order served on the administrators as garnishees; or
- ( c ) not  liable  to  termination  without  the  prior  consent  of the Court.
- (12)When  the  administrator  is  granted  the  power  to  add  a beneficiary at his discretion, such power shall be valid on condition that sufficient indication be given in the deed of foundation or in the beneficiary statement as to the class of which the beneficiary forms part. In the absence of such indication the power shall be null and void.
- (13)A person who may be appointed a beneficiary in terms of a power or discretion granted to the administrator shall not enjoy any rights in relation to the foundation or vis-à-vis the administrator and shall not be considered a beneficiary in any manner until appointed as a beneficiary by the administrator.
- (14)It  shall  be  lawful  for  an  administrator  to  be  granted  the power to decide at his absolute discretion, which beneficiaries are to benefit, the quantity of any benefit, at what time and in what manner beneficiaries are to benefit and such other powers relating to the appointment, application or advancement of property of the foundation.
- (15)A  beneficiary  in  whose  favour  a  discretion  to  distribute  or appoint property may be exercised shall have no rights to specific

property of the foundation until such time as such discretion is exercised by the appointment, application or advancement of such property in his favour.

- (16)A beneficiary may disclaim his whole interest in writing and such a disclaimer shall be irrevocable.
- (17)Subject to the terms of the deed of foundation, a beneficiary may disclaim part of his interest, whether or not he has received some benefit from his interest; in any such case, but subject to the terms of the foundation, a disclaimer may, by the instrument by which the interest is disclaimed, be made revocable, and shall then be capable of revocation in the manner and under the circumstances therein mentioned or referred to.
- (18)Subject to the terms of the foundation, a beneficiary may, by instrument in writing, sell, charge, transfer or otherwise deal with his interest in any manner.
- (19)Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  foundation,  the  following  rules shall apply where a foundation, or an interest under a foundation, is in favour of a class of persons:
- ( a ) a  class  closes  when  it  is  no  longer  possible  for  any other person to become a member of a class;
- ( b ) a woman who is over the age of fifty-five years shall be deemed to be no longer capable of bearing a child;
- ( c ) where any class interest relates to income and for any period there is no member of the class in existence, the income  shall  be  accumulated  and,  subject  to  article 29(7), shall be retained until there is a member of the class in existence or the class closes.
- (20) When permitted by the statute of a beneficiary foundation, beneficial interests may be established in the statute or a beneficiary statement in unitised form, of whatever nomenclature, where each unit reflects a share in the assets of the foundation with such rights to income, capital or other entitlements or powers as may be stated in the statute or beneficiary statement and if nothing is stated, proportionately to the total number of units:

Provided that the units may be subject to rules on recordation in a register of units, transfers, pledges and other such matters as the administrators may establish from time to time or as are provided in the statute. In such cases, the beneficial interest is presumed, unless otherwise stated in the statute or beneficial statement, to be subject to inheritance in favour of the beneficiary's heirs under his will or at law in case of intestacy and shall not terminate as provided for in sub-article (3).

- (21)In  the  event  that  a  private  interest  foundation  as  defined  in article 31B is dissolved for any reason at law, the assets of the foundation shall, subject to the performance of all obligations towards beneficiaries and any other terms of the foundation, be presumed to be held for the founder or his successors in title.

Endowments shall be considered to have been made under the same terms and conditions, for the same beneficiaries or for the same purposes, as the case may be, in terms of the statute of the foundation. Unless the provisions of sub-article (2) apply, the grantor of such endowments, if not the founder, shall have no status or powers in relation to the foundation and the endowment shall be referred to as an additional endowment.
2. (2)When  permitted  by  the  provisions  of  the  statute  or  with  the express concurrence of the founder, the supervisory council or protector, the administrators or, in default of such persons, the Court, a person, hereinafter referred to as "the grantor" may make an endowment in such a manner that he shall be considered to have the status and powers of a founder in the foundation in relation to such endowment or in relation to the whole foundation, or where such endowment is granted to a cell if so contemplated and consented to as aforesaid, such endowment shall be considered a new endowment.
3. (3)When such augmentation by third parties is made by means of a will, the testamentary disposition shall be deemed to require the creation of a new foundation and the administrators of the nominated foundation shall proceed accordingly, even without the concurrence of the persons mentioned in sub-article (2).
4. (4)Where the statute of a foundation provides for the establishment of segregated cells, a new endowment, whether transferred inter vivos or causa mortis , may be constituted as a new segregated cell by the administrators in which case the grantor's status and powers may be limited to such segregated cell. When a grantor becomes a new founder as aforesaid the rules in article 39 shall apply when there is more than one founder.

- (5)The administrators shall be bound to file with the Registrar, within three months from any grant, an inventory or descriptive note of the assets added to a foundation but in the case of cash endowments, only a certified copy of the relative bank deposit statement shall be filed with the Registrar.
- (6)In the event that endowments are received by such foundation in a regular manner in terms of a scheme which is registered with the Registrar, it shall not be required that the administrators file a descriptive note on each occasion that a new or additional endowment is made but they shall file a schedule of endowments on an annual basis. Neither shall it be required that the administrators enter into a public deed on each occasion that an endowment is made, unless the endowment involves immovable property. In each case, the administrators shall file the prescribed form and required attachments to notify such endowments to the Registrar.
- (7)Endowments may be granted under a condition, for a fixed time or in accordance with express rules stated in the statute. A new endowment may be made for purposes which are different from those of the foundation. In the absence of any indication, endowments shall be considered to be unconditional and made for the same purposes of the foundation.
- (8)Additional  and  new  endowments  to  public  benefit  foundations shall be irrevocable notwithstanding any term to the contrary in the constitutive instrument or statute of the foundation or the instrument providing for the additional or new endowment.
- (9)Unless expressly stated otherwise, additional and new endowments to beneficiary foundations shall be presumed to be irrevocable. The fact that an endowment is stated to be revocable, unless otherwise stated in the constitutive instrument or statute of the foundation or the instrument of additional or new endowment, shall not imply any limitation on the use or appointment of the capital or income by the administrators. In the case of revocation, the grantor shall only be entitled to the balance of capital which may remain unutilised.
- (10)Where, in the case of a beneficiary foundation, an additional or new endowment is made by two or more grantors jointly and expressed to be revocable such endowment may only be revoked with the express consent of all the grantors.
- (11)In  the  case  of  a  beneficiary  foundation,  the  revocation  of  an endowment shall not affect or invalidate acts already carried out or interrupt acts in progress, nor affect commitments made and not yet fulfilled. The revocation of an endowment shall be suspended until such time as the administrators certify to the Registrar that all commitments have been fulfilled and shall be deemed to refer only to such amount as shall not have been utilised in fulfilment of such commitments.
- (12)The  revocation  of  an  additional  or  new  endowment  shall  not imply the termination of a foundation but shall, unless otherwise stated in the statute, imply the cessation of the status of founder and all related rights in relation to the grantor.

- (13)If  a  foundation  is  the  beneficiary  of  a  new  or  additional endowment granted for specific purposes different from its own purposes, unless permitted in accordance with sub-article (5), the administrators shall seek new instructions from the grantor and if that is not possible, such endowment shall not be accepted and shall be deemed to require the creation of a new foundation and the administrators of the recipient foundation shall proceed accordingly.
- (14)When a foundation receives an endowment without sufficiently specific terms and from the circumstances it is evident that the foundation owes fiduciary duties in relation to such property towards a beneficiary or a class of beneficiaries or a purpose, the administrators shall execute a unilateral declaration by instrument in writing containing all the fiduciary terms under which the foundation is holding the same, comprising the information enabling the identification of all the beneficiaries or purposes. The administrators may ask the Court to confirm the contents of their declarations.
- (15) In the event that there are no administrators at the time of establishment or registration of a foundation, the founder or the person having the power to appoint administrators shall be deemed to have the power to accept any endowment but shall not have the power to bind the foundation on any other matter nor shall the foundation be entitled to commence operations prior to the appointment of the required number of administrators.
- (16)The  term  "endowment"  for  the  purposes  of  this  Title  shall mean any grant of money or other property under a gratuitous title, including rights to money or other property, existing or which may arise in the future.
35. (1) The persons named to be administrators of a foundation may be juridical persons provided they have at least three directors.
- (2)When a foundation is a public benefit foundation it shall have at least three administrators or at least one juridical person acting as administrator.
- (3)If the person nominated as an administrator in the constitutive instrument or statute is unwilling or unable to accept such responsibility, then he shall, within fifteen days, notify his intentions in writing to the Registrar, the founder or his heirs and the persons named as succeeding, if any. The taking of possession of any assets of a foundation shall imply acceptance to act as an administrator thereof and in such a case the administrator is bound to confirm his acceptance in writing to so act on demand of any interested person or the Registrar. Failure to do so within thirty days from a written request shall be a breach of duty by the administrator.
- (4)Any person named or appointed to succeed in administration shall enter into the same obligations as if he were the person named in the first place and shall notify the Registrar in writing upon taking up office. It shall be lawful for an administrator upon taking up office, but not later than thirty days after, to notify in writing the

Registrar and any interested parties of any reservations he may have regarding anything relating to the foundation or the actions of the previous administrators and he shall not be liable for any matters so reserved until such time as the reservations are operative.

(5)When  administrators,  both  those  originally  named  or  those succeeding, have made any acts of administration, they are bound to submit an account of their administration on relinquishing the administration in addition to such accounts as are required to be submitted in accordance with applicable law. Such account shall be submitted to the succeeding administrators or in their absence to the Registrar.

(6)Unless the deed of foundation provides otherwise, administrators may be remunerated from the income or capital of the foundation. Such remuneration shall be in such amounts and in such manner as may be stated in the deed of foundation or in any agreement between the founder and the administrator or in accordance with applicable law. Remuneration may also be established by the Court on application of the administrator or any interested party.

(7)Subject to the provisions of sub-article (8),  an administrator may resign from office by notice in writing to his co-administrators and in case of there being no other administrator, to the founder or to the beneficiaries or, if impracticable, to at least one beneficiary, or  i f   t h e r e   a r e   n o n e   t o   w h o m   n o t i c e   c a n   b e   g i v e n ,   t o   t h e administrator's duly appointed successor and the resignation shall take effect on delivery of the aforesaid notice.

- (8)A resignation -
- ( a ) given in order to facilitate a breach of duty, or
- ( b ) which would result in there being no administrator for the foundation,

shall have no effect; provided that an administrator may resign office notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph ( b ), if, before the resignation takes effect, application is made to the Court for the appointment of a new administrator and a new administrator is so appointed.

(9)An administrator shall cease to be an administrator immediately upon -

- (a) the  lapse  of  the  term  for  which  the  administrator  was appointed;
- ( b ) the removal of the administrator by any person or body having the power to do so in terms of the public deed of the foundation or by the Court on grounds stated in the deed of foundation or in this Schedule; or
- ( c ) steps  are  taken  for  the  winding  up  of  the  administrator when a legal person;
- ( d ) when the administrator is a legal person, the retirement, resignation or removal of all administrators, including directors in a company

acting  as  administrator,  from  their  office  in  the  said legal person or steps are taken for its winding up; or

- ( e ) where an administrator is appointed without  any indication of his duration of office and:
- (i) is the sole administrator, he shall require that the statute caters for a substitute administrator or the manner  in  which  a  new  administrator  may  be appointed  upon  his  retirement,  resignation  or removal. Where the administrator is in default of the obligation in this paragraph, a new administrator  may  be  appointed  to  substitute such administrator at any time with the consent of  the  founder,  of  any  person  designated  in  the statute  or  of  the  Court  in  the  absence  of  such persons; and
- (ii) there is more than one administrator, it is implied that  the  other  administrators  shall  have the  power  to  remove  the  administrator  at  any time  when  they  consider  that  he  is  unable  to carry out his functions  due  to health or in
- accordance with the provisions of article 9: Provided that in case of disagreement on any of the  matters  referred  to  in  this  paragraph,  the administrator  who  was  appointed  without  any indication of his duration in office may apply to the Court and demand that the Court issues such orders regarding his substitution, retirement, resignation or removal, as it considers appropriate after hearing the relevant persons.
- (10)An  administrator  ceasing  to  be  an  administrator  shall,  in addition to the duty to account under sub-article (5), be bound to immediately deliver all property of the foundation which may be in his possession to the remaining or successor administrators and to take all such formal or other actions as may be necessary in the interest of the foundation.
36. (1) The  founder,  and  such  other  persons  who  may  be designated in the deed of foundation, may exercise supervision over the administration of a foundation, obtain a copy of the accounts held by the administrators, a copy of the inventory or descriptive notes of property, and may intervene in the matter of appointment of administrators or in the disposal of the assets, when these issues are being dealt with by the Court. The founder may also be vested with powers to appoint, add or remove any administrators, protectors or beneficiaries and powers to appoint an investment adviser or investment manager and where a power mentioned in this sub-article has been reserved or exercised by the founder, an administrator who acts in accordance with any directions issued pursuant to the founder's power as aforesaid shall not be considered to be acting in breach of his fiduciary duties.
- (2)A  founder  may  be  an  administrator  or  a  protector  of  a foundation.

- (3)The  founder  may  also  be  the  beneficiary  of  a  beneficiary foundation during his lifetime:

Provided  that  when  the  founder  is  a  beneficiary,  such  founder may not at the same time act as the sole administrator of such a foundation.

- (4)It  shall  be  lawful  for  a  founder  to  give  non-binding  written guidance to the administrators on how to exercise the powers or discretions vested in them in the deed of foundation or the beneficiary statement and to substitute, modify or withdraw such guidance from time to time as the founder sees fit. A beneficiary may also be permitted to give such guidance by means of specific clauses in the deed of foundation or the beneficiary statement, and this, with effect from the date of death of the founder.
37. (1) The  terms  of  the  foundation  may  provide  for  the establishment of a supervisory council consisting of at least one member or for the office of a protector or protectors with similar functions.
- (2) The  founder  may  be  the  sole  or  one  of  the  members  of  the supervisory council or may also be a protector. However, a founder may not carry out the functions of a protector for as long as he holds the office of an administrator.
- (3) The members of the supervisory council or the protectors:
- ( a ) may be designated in the statute of the foundation; or
- ( b ) where no such designation is made, may be subsequently  appointed  by  the  administrators  and  in the manner prescribed in the statute; and
- ( c ) may  be  removed  and  replaced  by  the  administrators and in the manner prescribed in the statute.
- (4)The supervisory council or protectors shall not be considered to be administrators.
- (5)Subject to the terms of the foundation, the supervisory council or protectors shall have the power to exercise supervision over the acts of the administrators and may be vested with the power of appointment, removal, substitution or addition of administrators and such other powers as may be stated in the statute including the power to give guidance to the administrators in the exercise of their powers, discretions or duties.
- (6)The exercise of any power, action or discretion on the part of the administrators may be subject to the express consent of the supervisory council or the protectors.
- (7)Unless the statute of a foundation expressly states otherwise and until such time as the supervisory council or protectors are appointed, in the event that a deed of foundation contemplates a supervisory council or protectors whose consent or direction is needed for the administrators to carry out any act, the administrators shall be presumed to have the power to carry out any

Supervisory structure or protectors. Amended by: XXXVI.2018.80.

Rights of the beneficiaries. Amended by: XXXVI.2018.81; XXXIX.2020.23.

act without such consent or direction:

Provided  that,  the  decision  to  act  without  consent  is  taken unanimously by the administrators.

(8)The  presumption  in  sub-article  (7)  shall  not  apply  if  the statute requires the administrators or any of them to appoint the members of the supervisory council or the protectors.

38. (1) An  administrator  shall,  so  far  as  is  reasonable  and within a reasonable time of receiving a request in writing to that effect, provide full and accurate information as to the state and amount of the foundation property, including the accounts of the foundation, and subject to sub-article (2), the conduct of the administration to -
2. ( a ) the founder;
3. ( b ) the Court;
4. ( c ) the supervisory council or protectors;
5. ( d ) any other person who is vested with such right in the deed of foundation;
6. ( e ) subject to the terms of the foundation, any beneficiary of the foundation who is of full age and capacity, or if a minor, to his lawful guardian or representative;
7. ( f ) subject to the terms of the foundation, any other public benefit  organisation  or  charitable  trust  referred  to  by name  for  the  benefit  of  which  the  foundation  was established; and
8. ( g ) in  case  of  a  foundation  established for  a purpose,  the Attorney General or the relevant authority under applicable law.

(2)Subject to the terms of the foundation and to any order of the Court given for special reasons, an administrator or any other person shall not be required to disclose to any person any document or information relating to a private interest foundation which -

- ( a ) discloses  the  administrator's  deliberations  as  to  the manner in which a power or discretion was exercised, or a duty conferred or imposed by law or by the terms of the foundation was performed;
- ( b ) discloses the reason for any particular exercise of such power  or  discretion  or  performance  of  duty  or  the material upon which such reason will be or might have been based;
- ( c ) relates  to  the  exercise  or  proposed  exercise  of  such power  or  discretion  or  the  performance  or  proposed performance of such duty.

(3)Unless  the  terms  of  the  foundation  expressly  determine  the time when and the method how beneficiaries are to be informed of their entitlement under the foundation, the administrator shall be obliged to inform any beneficiary of his entitlement, in writing,

within a reasonable time of his accepting to act.

(4)When the terms of the foundation grant a discretion in terms of article 33(9) of this Schedule, the terms of the foundation may suspend, until such time as a discretion is exercised in their favour, the duty of the administrator to inform such beneficiaries that they may benefit under the foundation or that they form part of a class of beneficiaries which may so benefit. The terms of the foundation may also indicate the time when and the method of how such beneficiaries are to be informed.

(5)If the deed of foundation expressly provides for the notification of information to beneficiaries or to those persons that form part of a class from among which beneficiaries may be appointed, without reference to any point in time, ascertained or ascertainable, such term shall be construed as implying a duty of the administrator to inform such beneficiaries within a reasonable time after the death of the founder.

(6)Should  the  administrator  consider  providing  information  as required by the preceding sub-articles to be prejudicial to the beneficiaries of the foundation or any of them, the administrator may apply to the Court and the Court may release the administrator from the obligation to inform under such conditions as it may consider appropriate.

(7)The  duty  to  inform  as  above  provided  shall  not  arise  if  the administrator is in possession of information which reasonably demonstrates that those entitled to such information have already been informed or are already aware of such information.

(8)In the case of a purpose foundation, the duty to inform either unnamed beneficiaries forming part of a class or persons forming part of a class of persons who may be appointed as beneficiaries in t e r m s   o f   a   p o w e r   o f   t h e   a d m i n i s t r a t o r ,   s h a l l   n o t   a r i s e notwithstanding the terms of the foundation unless, in case of the unnamed beneficiaries the administrator establishes that there exist l e s s   t h a n   t e n   b e n e f i c i a r i e s   a p p e r t a i n i n g   t o   s u c h   c l a s s   o f beneficiaries. Furthermore, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, the unnamed beneficiaries or persons who may be added as beneficiaries in terms of a power shall be assumed to be persons who carry on relevant social or other activities principally in Malta.

- (9)The administrator shall carry out the duty to inform to the best of his abilities and at the expense of the foundation and in the event it appears to the administrator that such exercise will be too costly or burdensome, the administrator may apply to the Court for directions and the Court shall be empowered to release the administrator from such duty under such conditions as it considers appropriate.

(10)The  suspension  of  the  duty  of  an  administrator  to  inform beneficiaries as provided in this article shall not reduce the rights of beneficiaries or the duties and liability of the administrator towards such beneficiaries in terms of this Schedule or other applicable law.

- (11)Persons  who  may  be  added  as  beneficiaries  in  terms  of  a

- (3) Notwithstanding  anything  stated  in  the  statute  or  in  subarticle (2), after the death of the founder, the Court shall have the power to dissolve and wind up any beneficiary foundation when requested to do so by all the beneficiaries of the foundation if it is satisfied that the continuance of the foundation is no longer necessary to achieve the intentions of the founder or is otherwise unreasonable.
- (4) The  statute  of  a  foundation  may  provide  that  it  may  be terminated at any time but termination shall not affect or invalidate acts already lawfully carried out or interrupt lawful acts in progress. Nor shall termination affect lawful commitments made and not yet fulfilled. Termination shall be suspended until such time as the administrators certify to the Registrar that all lawful commitments have been fulfilled.
- (5) The  express  reservation  by  the  founder  of  the  right  to terminate a foundation shall not be exercisable by the heirs or spouse of such founder unless expressly provided otherwise in the deed of foundation. Without prejudice to any other remedies available at law, creditors of the founder may not exercise the right to terminate a foundation.
- (6) When a foundation is terminated, the procedures in article 59 shall apply.

- (7) Except  in  cases  contemplated  in  article  47(2),  where  a foundation is converted into a trust, termination of registration shall imply termination of the foundation but not of the fiduciary obligations therein contained and upon notice of the conversion, the Registrar shall proceed to strike off the foundation.
- (8) The  administrators  shall  have  a  duty  to  maintain  in  good standing the registration of a foundation until it is terminated as provided for in this article.
- (9) Public  benefit  foundations  may  only  be  constituted  in  an irrevocable manner and, without prejudice to the power to terminate such a foundation in accordance with article 32 for the reasons and subject to the conditions therein stated, any clause in the statute reserving the right for the founder or any other person or body to revoke such foundation shall not apply.
41. The  Court  shall  have  jurisdiction  in  relation  to  all  noncontentious matters which are internal to the foundation, its administrators and beneficiaries:

Provided  that  if  a  non-contentious  matter  being  examined by the Court becomes contentious, the Court shall declare the proceedings before it to be contentious and shall continue to deal with the matter as a contentious issue, providing the parties the opportunity to promote the claim and respond to it according to law.

42. (1) Subject  to  the  provisions  of  sub-article  (3)  the  Court may, if it thinks fit, by order approve on behalf of -

- (2) The  Court  shall  not  approve  an  arrangement  on  behalf  of any person coming within sub-article (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ), unless it is satisfied that the carrying out of such arrangement appears to be for the benefit of that person.

Provided  that,  where  the  provisions  of  this  Schedule  are  not consistent with the special laws, the special laws shall prevail.

- ( c ) when the share of the profits or losses, or the benefit or other  interests,  is  not  determined  on  the  basis  of  a designated proportion, the liability of a member shall be based on the proportion which his monetary contribution  bears  to  the  total  contributions  of  the members.

The matters referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) shall be determined on the basis of express provisions in the statute and absent any such provisions, the liability to third parties shall be equally borne by the members and any private agreement among members shall not affect the rights of third parties.

- ( a ) article  16  if  the  association  is  registered  with  the Registrar; and

In the event that more than three persons wish to establish an association, a statement may be made of this fact in the statute and the signature of three persons on behalf of all associating members stated in a schedule to the statute shall be sufficient to indicate the consent of all stated persons.
- ( b ) Where an association is being established as a public benefit  association  involving more  than  three  persons as  promoters, the  signature  of  three  persons  shall  be sufficient to indicate the consent of all other associating members at the time of establishment.
- ( c ) A document containing  a  list  of  all  other  associating members shall be sufficient evidence of their consent and notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, in respect of the persons listed in the document containing  the  list  of  all  associating  members,  their name, surname and identity card, passport number or registration  number,  as  applicable,  shall  suffice.  A

- declaration by the three persons that they are authorised  to  act  on  behalf  of  all  other  associating members shall be recorded under their signature
- ( d ) When such  association is  constituted  by  public  deed, the Notary Public shall not be bound to ascertain that the three persons have been authorised by the associating  members  to  appear  on  the  deed  but  shall rely  on  the  document  submitted  to  him  by  the  three persons containing a list of all associating members as evidence of their consent. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, in respect of the persons listed in the document  containing the list of all associating members, their name, surname and identity card, passport number  or registration number, as applicable, shall suffice.
- ( e ) The Notary Public who receives any deed to which this sub-article refers shall record in the deed a declaration by  the  three  persons  that  they  are  authorised  by  the associating  members  to  state  their  names,  surnames and  identity  card,  passport  number  or  registration number, as applicable, in the document above referred to and the said Notary Public shall warn the said three persons of the importance of the truthfulness of such declaration.

- ( g ) Any  person  named  as  an  associating  member  in  a document as referred to above who claims that he did not authorise the three persons to include his name and surname and identity card, passport number or registration  number,  as  applicable,  in  the  document shall, within sixty (60) days of his becoming aware of his inclusion in the document, be entitled to register a declaration to that effect in the Register of the association and in the lack of any written evidence to the contrary which may be produced in case of dispute on such matter he shall not be considered ever to have been an associating member.

50. (1) The statute of an association must clearly specify a purpose.
- (2)The  assets  of  an  association  may  originate  from  any  lawful business or activity and may consist of present or future assets of any nature.
- (3)Failure to specify a purpose shall result in the nullity of the agreement and the Registrar shall not accept to register such an association until such time as the purpose is clear and

unambiguous.

- (4)The members of an association may add to the purpose for the achievement of which the association was originally created, by extending it to cover such other purposes of a similar nature as are clearly set down in a second written instrument consented to by such number of members as is necessary to amend the statute.
- (5)A public benefit association may not have its purpose changed or extended to other purposes which are not also public benefit purposes and a non-profit-making association cannot change its statute to an organisation promoting a private interest.
- (6)A restriction on the number of members which is proportionate to the physical and other resources of an association from time to time or the existence of a membership committee with the power to accept or refuse new members in an association, shall not, on its own, imply that such association is one for private benefit.
51. (1) Subject to the provisions of article 12(3), all associations shall be eligible to register under the provisions of this Title.
- (2) For the purpose of registration of an association an authentic copy of the constitutive instrument is to be delivered to and filed with the Registrar by the administrators.
- (3)Where the association is created by a public deed an authentic copy thereof may be delivered by the administrators provided for in the said deed (when they have accepted to act as such) or the Notary publishing the said deed and the delivery by any one of them shall suffice.
- (4)The  document  referred  to  in  article  49(4)  relating  to  the  other associating members, when such is the case, at the time of establishment shall also be delivered to the Registrar for registration.
- (5)The name, surname and identity card or passport or registration number, as applicable, of every person who joins an association as a member after this has been established and, or registered, shall be entered in a register of members which shall be regularly updated. A record of the persons who leave the association shall also be maintained in the said register of members.
- (6)Such  register  of  members  shall  not  be  registered  with  the Registrar but this shall be without prejudice to the right of any person, subject to Court authorisation, and to the right of the Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations in the case of a voluntary organisation, and to the right of the Malta Financial Services Authority in the case of entities which are regulated or which appear to be carrying out regulated activities for which it is t h e   c o m p e t e n t   a u t h o r i t y   u n d e r   a p p l i c a b l e   l a w,   t o   r e q u i r e information about members subject to the provisions of applicable law.

(3)In the  absence of specific provisions in the statute, at meetings of the members, decisions shall be taken by the majority of those present at the meeting except that:

- ( a ) when  decisions  are  taken  on  the  amendment  of  the statute  such  decisions  must  be  supported  by  at  least fifty-one per cent of all the registered members on the basis of one vote per member;
- ( b ) when decisions are taken to terminate the association or  to  donate  to  another  organisation  all  of  its  assets, such  decision  must  be  supported  by  at  least  seventyfive per cent of all the members; and

2. (2)The  provisions  of  article  35  shall mutatis  mutandis apply  to administrators of associations except as herein provided.
3. (3)An  association  established  for  the  promotion  of  a  private benefit may be administered by only one administrator and such administrator may also be a registered legal organisation on condition that such legal organisation has at least one administrator in office.

(4)In the case of a private benefit association, the administrators of the association may be appointed in any manner whether by notice in writing from any member or class thereof, by elections among the members, by designation to an office by the administrators or otherwise as the statute may establish and for any term or function, subject to the provisions of sub-article (5) for indefinite appointments.

(5)In the case of a public benefit association the same rules shall apply but notwithstanding the provisions of the statute:

- ( b ) it shall be required that a majority of the administrators shall be subject to confirmation by the general  meeting  of  the  members  at  least  once  every five (5) years:

Provided that when the provisions of sub-article (6) apply, such administrators as are appointed indefinitely shall not be subject to such confirmation.

- (6) When an administrator is appointed indefinitely, such appointment shall imply a power of the general meeting to remove such administrator at any time when it considers that he is unable to carry out his functions due to health or under article 9:

Provided  that  in  case  of  disagreement  on  any  of  the  matters referred to in this sub-article, the administrator who is appointed indefinitely may request the Court to issue such orders as it considers appropriate after hearing the relevant persons.

(2)Every person who is a member of an association shall be free to leave the association and such member cannot be subjected to any liability, other than for unpaid fees, on leaving an association:

Provided  that  in  an  unregistered  association,  when  a  member leaves the association, this does not affect his liability under the applicable law for the period while he was a member but he shall not be liable in relation to any activities of the association after such time.

(3)If  the  number  of  paid  up  members  of  an  association  falls below three, and in case of an association which may be established between two person in accordance with article 27, falls below two, the administrators are bound to proceed with a written call for payment of dues to the members informing them that non-payment will lead to termination under this provision and on the lapse of the said period, with the winding up of the association under this Schedule.

(4)Any expulsion procedure in a statute, except for failure to pay membership fees or to comply with other purely formal conditions of membership, should cater for:

- ( a ) the  non-participation  of  persons  with  an  interest  in  a dispute, in the decision to expel;
- ( b ) the right of the member whose expulsion is sought to make submissions to the persons who are empowered to decide.

(5)If  the  statute  of  an  association  does  not  provide  for  the procedures mentioned in sub-article (4), the administrators shall be bound to implement a procedure which respects the rules stated in the previous sub-article:

Provided that endowments  shall be subject to the written acceptance of the administrators or as otherwise required by the statute and such endowment, when accepted, shall imply that the grantor has become a member of the organisation, unless otherwise expressly agreed or provided for in the statute in relation to endowments, with the same rights and obligations and otherwise in accordance with the statute and the provisions of this Schedule.

- (2)Membership fees are not endowments and shall not be treated as such nor shall they be refundable except as expressly stated in the statute.
- (3)When an association has a private benefit, new or additional endowments shall generally be considered to be contributions to the capital of the association and the following rules shall apply:
- ( a ) an  endowment  shall  be  subject  to  the  consent  of  the administrators or as otherwise required by the statute;
- ( b ) an endowment  when  accepted, shall constitute a contribution in favour of the association and in favour of the grantor who shall thereupon become a member, and if he is already a member of the association, such contribution  shall  be  considered  to  be  an  additional endowment to his initial endowment;
- ( c ) unless otherwise agreed or stated in the statute or if the subject  is  not  addressed  in  any  agreement  or  the statute,  it  shall  be  presumed  that  the  contributions shall  be  the  basis  of  proportionality  of  all  rights  and obligations within the organisation;
- ( d ) the statute may regulate and establish rules, which may be  based  on  principles  other  than  proportionality,  on the following matters:
- (i) the rights of members in relation to their contributions  with  regard  to  voting,  sharing  in profits and losses and participation in capital on dissolution;
- (ii) participation in management of the organisation and  rights  to  be  appointed  or  elected  as  and appoint or elect administrators;
- (iii) subject to the rights of third parties being protected, the manner in which the contributions of the members may be withdrawn or otherwise paid back to them.
56. (1) An  association  shall  exist  until  it  is  terminated  in accordance with the provisions of its statute or in terms of this Title unless the members, upon being given thirty days' written notice of termination by the administrators, amend the statute to establish other purposes to which the property of the association may be dedicated.
- (2)The termination of an association shall not affect or invalidate lawful acts already carried out nor interrupt lawful acts in progress.

Termination of registration.

Nor shall termination affect lawful commitments made and not yet fulfilled. Termination shall be suspended until such time as the administrators certify to the Registrar that all lawful commitments have been fulfilled.

- ( c ) to the Government of Malta if the purposes are general public  benefit  or  utility  when  the  Government  has granted the association a substantial part of its assets, as the administrators or the members  in general meeting may determine in accordance with the provisions of article 52(3)(b).

## Title IV

## OF WINDING UP OF ORGANISATIONS

57. (1) An  organisation  may  request  the  termination  of  its registration by means of a written request signed by all its administrators or as otherwise required by its statute, and rendering a statement of accounts, declaring the assets and liabilities of the organisation and stating how they are to be dealt with on termination of registration.

- (2)The termination of registration shall not imply the winding up of an organisation. Organisations may continue as unregistered organisations subject to the application of the relevant rules of this Schedule.
- (3)Any  interested  party  or  any  competent  authority  may,  in accordance with the provisions of this Title, apply to the Court for t h e   t e r m i n a t i o n   o f   r e g i s t r a t i o n   a n d ,   o r   t h e   c e s s a t i o n   o f   a n organisation.
- (4)The termination of registration of an organisation on the order of the Court, on the basis of grounds which imply that the organisation may no longer operate, shall include an order by the Court requiring the cessation of such organisation as a legal person and as an organisation. In such a case such organisation may not continue to exist as an unregistered organisation.
58. (1) Without prejudice to any special law regulating the form or purpose of an organisation, an organisation may be wound up voluntarily or by order of the Court.
- (2)In this Sub-Title, the term "organisation" includes both those organisations which are registered and those which are not.
59. (1) An organisation is wound up voluntarily by following the procedures laid down in the statute of the organisation. Unless otherwise stated, the winding up of an organisation shall require the support of a majority of all members, in case of an association, or a majority of all administrators, in case of a foundation:
- Provided  that  the  local  representative  may  also  wind  up  the organisation if he has not received any form of notification from any of the administrators for a period which exceeds twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
- (2)A certified copy of a winding up resolution shall be delivered to the Registrar within fourteen days from when it is passed.
- (3)An  organisation  may  be  wound  up  voluntarily  only  if  its assets exceed its liabilities or its assets have been exhausted and all its debts have been paid. The administrators shall prepare a scheme of distribution of the remaining assets of the organisation which shall be notified to the Registrar and all interested parties. It shall require approval by members, or in case of foundations, by the founder or the beneficiaries, as the case may be, or in their absence the Registrar, before being implemented.
- (4)Once the scheme of distribution is approved, the administrators shall proceed to pay out the remaining assets of the organisation in accordance with such scheme of distribution.
60. (1) In the absence of a clear statement in the statute of a public benefit organisation, as to how assets are to be disposed of on termination of the organisation, the administrators may apply for directions and shall dispose of the assets as ordered by the Court.

established for a private benefit and in the absence of an indication in the statute of how assets are to be distributed in case of winding up, the assets shall be paid to the beneficiaries or members, or, to the founders or promoters or their heirs at law after payment of all expenses, as may be determined by the Court after hearing the proposals of the administrators, the founders or promoters if alive, the beneficiaries or members and any other interested parties, keeping in view the intentions of the founder.

61. The  administrators  of  an  organisation  shall  be  bound  to dissolve and wind up an organisation when the term for which it has been created, if any, has expired or if its purpose has been achieved or becomes impossible. The founder or members may amend the statute at any time, even after such event, to remove the reason for dissolution as stated by this article, in which case any determination of the administrators and any dissolution proceedings shall be terminated and shall have no effect.
62. (1) An  organisation  shall  be  wound  up  on  order  of  the Court, upon the application from any interested party, for reasons valid at law in terms of its statute or this Schedule.
3. (2)The Court may order the winding up of an organisation on an application to this effect if it considers it necessary in the public interest or if the provisions of this Schedule or any other laws are not being observed by the organisation and the Court considers the situation to be so grave as to merit such an order, the ordinary r e m e d i e s   f o r   b r e a c h   o f   l a w s   n o t   b e i n g   s u f f i c i e n t   i n   t h e circumstances.

(3)In  the  case  of  a  private  interest  foundation  as  defined  under article 31B, the power to request its winding up in terms of this article shall be exercisable also by the Malta Financial Services Authority.

- (4)In the case of a public benefit organisation which makes public collections, the power to request its winding up in terms of this article shall be exercisable by any member of the public.
63. The Court shall outline the reasons for any order given under the preceding article and steps to be taken in relation to all assets of any relevant organisation, including the appointment of a liquidator for such organisation. The administrators and any person interested shall be entitled to appeal to the Court of Appeal within fifteen days of any such order.
64. (1) If an organisation becomes insolvent or is undergoing serious difficulties which impede the organisation from operating and achieving its aims, the administrators shall cease operations and notify the Registrar who shall immediately co-operate with the administrators to appoint a liquidator to wind up the affairs in the i n t e r e s t   o f   c r e d i t o r s ,   t h e   p r o m o t e r s   o r   b e n e f i c i a r i e s   o f   t h e organisation and the organisation itself.

(2)In  this  Title  "insolvency"  shall  mean  the  inability  to  pay  its debts when due and for three months after a debt is judicially acknowledged or admitted or if it is proved to the satisfaction of the

Court that the organisation is unable to pay its debts, account being taken of its assets and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities.

(3)If the organisation does not have any administrators for more than six months and suitable persons are not appointed by the Court on the application of any interested person, the Registrar shall proceed to demand from the Court an order for the winding up of the organisation and the appointment of a liquidator. In the case of a private interest foundation as defined in article 31B such power to apply to the Court shall also be vested in the Malta Financial Services Authority.

- (4)Upon such order, the liquidator shall take over all assets of the organisation and shall notify all creditors, if necessary by means of public notices, and shall seek appropriate solutions to any issue which may arise. The liquidator shall have the power to dispose of all assets and pay all debts, observing the ranking order of creditors as provided by law in making payments to creditors.
- (5)The  liquidator shall consult  the  Court  which  shall  give directions from time to time for the resolution of disputes and the distribution of assets. The liquidator and any creditor may apply to the Court at any time for orders in the liquidation. The Court shall have the power to give any orders it deems appropriate.
- (6)The same rules shall mutatis  mutandis apply  in  cases  where organisations have been found to be operating illegally or are abandoned and the Registrar is unable to obtain the co-operation of the administrators or other interested persons for the formal winding up of the organisation.
65. On  receipt of a declaration by the administrators or liquidators or on otherwise being satisfied that all assets have been appropriately exhausted as required by law and that all assets have been distributed in accordance with the approved scheme of distribution, the Registrar shall cancel the registration of the organisation which shall thereby be struck off the Register of Legal Persons and the organisation shall thereafter cease to exist.
66. Should it result that the assets or liabilities of an organisation which has been cancelled were not determined or dealt with, distributed, paid out or otherwise liquidated, the Court shall, on the demand of any founder, the last serving administrators or any member, have all necessary powers to revive the organisation, and any cell thereof, only for the purpose of determining and dealing with or paying out or liquidating such assets or liabilities.
67. The  winding  up  of  an  organisation  shall  not  affect  the continuing validity or effect of another organisation established by it. In such a case the role of the founding organisation, if any, shall be carried out by the successor in title of the organisation or by such person or persons as may be appointed by the Court. For an organisation to be wound up any segregated cells which may be in existence must be wound up prior to the winding up of the organisation.

(3)If any  creditor or any  other interested party  who  feels aggrieved by the fact that the name of the organisation has been struck off the Register by virtue of this article, the Court, on an application made by such creditor or any other interested party before the expiration of five years from the publication of the notice of the striking off provided for in sub-article (2) may, if satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to revoke the Registrar's order to strike off the organisation, order that such name be restored to the Register, and upon an official copy of the order being delivered by the Registrar of the Courts to the Registrar for registration, the organisation shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had not been struck off.

(4)Subject  to  the  provisions  of  sub-article  (3),  the  Court  may give such directions and make such provisions it deems appropriate for placing the organisation and all other interested parties in the same position as they were before the name of the organisation had been struck off. The Registrar shall forthwith proceed to publish a notice in the Gazette and in a daily newspaper circulating wholly or mainly in Malta that the name of the organisation has been restored to the Register.

(5)Notwithstanding  that  the  name  of  the  organisation  has  been struck off the Register in terms of the preceding provisions of this article,  the  liability,  if  any,  of  every  promoter,  founder, administrator, member, of the organisation shall continue and may be enforced as if the name of the organisation had not been struck off the Register.

- ( e ) except when the Declassification Resolution expressly authorises  modification  of  any  thing  in  the  public domain,  any  damages,  destruction  or  modification  or exploitation other than that expressly permitted, shall be made good at the expense of the grantee;
- ( f ) unless  expressly permitted  by  the  Declassification Resolution,  and  in  such  case  subject  to  the  express conditions of the grant, the grant shall:
- (i)be personal to the grantee thereof and shall not be assignable and when the grant is made to a legal organisation or a trust which has shareholders or beneficiaries, as the case may be, such shareholders or beneficiaries shall be subject to the  same  conditions  together  with the legal organisation or trust during the duration of such grant;
- (ii) not be capable of division; and
- (iii) not be capable of being the subject of security in favour of a third party:

Provided that when the grant by the Government is made to an enrolled voluntary organisation the purposes of which reflect the same principles of this Schedule relating to the manner of administration of any property in the public domain, the conditions mentioned above may be modified or waived.

- (2)The  preceding  sub-article  shall  be  subject  to  the  following additional rules of interpretation:
- ( a ) should  a  grant  be  made  for  more  than  one  hundred years, it shall be valid only for one hundred years;
- ( b ) should the grant exceed the term stated in the Declassification Resolution, then the term of the grant shall  be  reduced ipso  jure to  the  term  stated  in  the Declassification Resolution;
- ( c ) should the grant be made for a purpose not specified in the  Declassification  Resolution,  then  such  grant  shall be null and void and no rights whatsoever shall accrue to any party by virtue thereof.
- (3)Nothing  in  this  Schedule  or  any  Declassification  Resolution shall hinder the imposition by the Government of more onerous or restrictive conditions at the time of any grant or disposal of the relevant property in the public domain in order to better protect or preserve the public domain nature of the property.
9. (1) When a thing in the public domain has been subjected to private rights, on the termination, howsoever this occurs, of such

private rights, such thing shall revert ipso jure t o   t h e   p u bl i c domain. On reversion, the thing shall be free from all rights and claims, both personal and real.

(2)Such reversion shall also occur following the expiration of the stated term or the impossibility or exhaustion of the purpose and use for which the thing was declassified or granted, as the case may be.

- (3)Any thing which has, within the term of the original Declassification Resolution, reverted to public domain in accordance with this article may be re-granted for the remaining period of the original grant without a new declassification provided it is so re-granted within twelve months of the reversion.

(4)When a declassified thing reverts to the public domain after the lapse of the specified term of the grant, the Government shall seek to return the property into the public domain for at least twenty-five years before declassifying it again, unless with the support of a resolution of the House of Representatives.

(5)When immovable property in the public domain is declassified and the declassification is expressly declared to be indefinite in duration due to the irreversibility of the intended use permitted by declassification, reversion to public domain shall not take place and the property shall remain private or public free of any public domain obligations including those referred to in article 4(10) of this Schedule.

## Title VI

## OF DECLASSIFICATION OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN

10. (1) All things which are in the public domain, by nature or by operation of the law, can be designated to be available for -

- ( a ) the  use  and  administration  of  such  property  by  the Government as public property; or
- ( b ) the grant of titles or rights in favour of private interests;

in accordance with the use to which the thing can lend itself, generally without permitting the permanent alteration of its nature. Such designations shall be for a purpose or purposes which are specifically defined and being in the public interest. The Executive Council as established under the Development Planning Act of 2016 shall receive such requests by the Minister responsible for Lands to prepare a report following a public consultation process. The report shall be referred to the Standing Committee for Environment and Development Planning who in turn following its consideration and comments shall forward its conclusions to the Minister responsible for Lands. The Minister shall present to the House of Representatives for its consideration, a Declassification Resolution. Such things shall be referred to as declassified things.

(2)Following  declassification,  the  declassified  things  shall  still retain their nature as public domain and, to the extent not

- (4)Declassification  cannot  take  place  except  after  a  minimum period of five years has elapsed, with regard to any public domain property, from the date of enactment of a Public Domain Resolution with regard to that property in particular, as mentioned in article 4(2) of this Schedule.
- (5)Declassified  things  belonging  to  the  Government  become capable of being the subject of a contract for the period of declassification and are rendered susceptible to real rights and charges and other encumbrances:

Provided  that  any  real  rights,  charges  and  other  encumbrances shall terminate ipso jure on the expiration of the contract term or on the lapse of the declassification period, whichever is the earlier.

- (6)The modification or conversion of things in the public domain following declassification may be permitted by a Declassification Resolution on condition that such modification or conversion shall seek an outcome where the gain achieved by the general public is clear and unambiguous.

- (2)Every Declassification Resolution shall, as a minimum:

- ( b ) identify  the  term,  unless  indefinite  in  scope  in  which case it shall state so, the purpose and the use for which declassification is taking place;

- ( d ) identify any known Government powers or third party rights  which  shall  continue  to  be  enjoyed  over  the thing  notwithstanding  the  declassification,  provided that this is without prejudice to the general powers of the Government under any law and to private titles or rights which may be registered within the time period prescribed by law;
- ( e ) seek  to  identify  special  laws  or  provisions  thereof,  if any,  which  restrict  the  public  access  or  enjoyment  of such  property  in  accordance  with  this  Schedule  and

which shall continue to apply to such property notwithstanding the declassification; and

- ( f ) where applicable, be accompanied by a plan or general map, based on the official map of the Land Registry, identifying the property and its accessories which are affected by such declassification.

(3)All  Declassification  Resolutions  shall  be  registered  in  the relevant registry by the Minister responsible for Lands within two months of the coming into force of the Act.

- (4)Any grant made by the Government pursuant to a Declassification Resolution shall be registered in the relevant registry in accordance with applicable law.
- (5)Any  amendments  or  revocations  made  to  Declassification Resolutions shall be registered by the Minister responsible for Lands in the relevant registry within two months from when such amendments or revocations are made.
12. (1) In the following cases:
- ( a ) where the thing has reverted  to  its  former  public  use without  objection  of  the  title  or  rights  holder  for  a continuous period of two years;
- ( b ) where  it  is  used  for  a  purpose  which  does  not  fall within  the  parameters  for  which  the  declassification was made;
- ( c ) where the term for which it was declassified expires;
- ( d ) where there is a substantial breach of the terms of any grant, concession or an abuse of right;

the grantee shall be notified by judicial letter and, upon the lapse of thirty days from such notification, the thing shall revert to the public domain, unless such reversion is formally contested in a court, in which case the effects are suspended until the court decides the matter or the parties agree that compliance has been achieved:

Provided  that  during  any  such  contestation  the  duty  of  the grantee to pay any agreed compensation and to perform all public domain obligations shall not be affected in any manner and in the event of breach pendente lite , the court shall, even without demand on the part of the Government, order the reversion to the public domain on the basis of such breach without the need to determine the issues under contestation.

- (2)Where it is established by a final judgement of a court of civil or criminal jurisdiction that the declassification was the fruit of corruption, the declassification shall be invalid and all rights accruing to any person pursuant thereto shall be null and void.
- (3)Any person formerly vested with title to or rights over a thing in the public domain shall, upon the happening of the events in the preceding sub-articles, ipso jure become a mere holder and shall have no further rights from the moment of notification and, without prejudice to any other rights competent at law, the Government

Provided that the third party shall not enjoy such protection if he consents to or participates in the breach giving rise to the default or does not otherwise act in good faith when seeking protection under this article.

13. (1) When  third  party  rights  are  granted  on  declassified immovables, the rights shall attach only to the things fastened to the site and any improvements thereto as well as to its use but not to any fruits or accessories to such immovables unless expressly agreed.

(2)On  termination  of  a  grant  of  declassified  things,  the  person who enjoyed the rights to the use and enjoyment of the things shall, at his expense, take all such action as is necessary to ensure that things which may have been constructed or fastened to the property shall be removed and the thing be restored to its condition prior to the declassification or to as near a condition as possible, such assessment to be made by the Government, unless the Government approves their retention in accordance with article 8(1)( d ) of this Schedule or consents to their permanent modification or conversion in the Declassification Resolution.

(3)In  the  event  that  the  thing  is  not  restored  to  the  appropriate condition, the Government shall have the power to clear the property of any constructions, fastening or any other thing whatsoever and shall have the power to administer and dispose of the same. Additionally, the Government shall enjoy a special privilege over such things and to any proceeds coming from the lease, operation or sale of such things. The Government shall be entitled to take from such proceeds any sum equivalent to the costs and expenses incurred in restoring the thing to its original condition but shall have no interest whatsoever in any excess proceeds which shall be kept on trust for the grantee:

Provided  that  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  grant,  following  the termination of a grant, the Government may, at its discretion, acquire any immovable thing remaining on the property upon payment of a fair price to the grantee or relevant owner of the immovable, such price to be determined by agreement or by the court in case of disagreement.

14. (1) When property becomes part of the coastal perimeter by human intervention, including excavation or development or conversion into a marina, promenade, breakwater or otherwise, it shall not thereby become public domain but shall be subject to:
2. ( a ) any special  conditions  which  may  be  imposed  in  any

Declassification  Resolution  or  any  permit  for  such intervention; and

- ( b ) any  special  laws  which  may  be  applicable  to  its development and use.
