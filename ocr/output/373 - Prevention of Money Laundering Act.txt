Provided that where legal representation no longer vests in the said person, for purposes of this article, legal representation shall vest in the person occupying the office in his stead or in such person as is referred to in that article.

- (5) ( a ) Without prejudice to the provisions of article 23 of the Criminal  Code  the  court  shall,  in  addition  to  any punishment  to  which  the  person  convicted  of  an offence of money laundering under this Act may be sentenced and in addition to any penalty to which a body corporate may become liable under the provisions of sub-article (4), order the forfeiture in favour of the Government of the proceeds or of such property the value  of  which  corresponds  to  the  value  of  such proceeds whether such proceeds have been received by the  person  found  guilty  or  by  the  body  corporate referred to in the said sub-article (4) and any property of  or  in  the  possession  or  under  the  control  of  any person found guilty as aforesaid or of a body corporate

as mentioned in this sub-article shall, unless proved to the contrary, be deemed to be derived from the offence of  money laundering and liable to confiscation or forfeiture by the court even if in the case of immovable property such property has since the offender was charged passed into the hands of third parties, and even if the proceeds of property, movable or immovable, are situated in any place outside Malta:

The  said fine  shall  be  recoverable  as  a  civil  debt  and  for  this purpose  the  sentence  of  the  court  shall  constitute  an executive title for all intents and purposes of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.
- ( c ) Where it is established that the value of the property of the  person  found  guilty  of  an  offence  of  money laundering  under  this  Act  is  disproportionate  to  his lawful income and the court based on specific facts is fully convinced that the property in question has been derived from the criminal activity of that person, that property shall be liable to forfeiture.
