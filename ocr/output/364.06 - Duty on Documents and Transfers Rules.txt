Provided  further  that  where  the  transferee  does  not hold any shares in the company immediately before or after  the  change,  the  value  of  "A"  or  "B"  in  the  said formula, as the case may be, shall be taken as zero:

- (i) the  real  value  of  shares  held  in  a  company  is  a percentage  of  the  real  value  of  the  said  company corresponding  to  the  percentage  of  the  issued  share capital  represented  by  the  nominal  value  of  those shares;
- (ii) where the issued share capital of the company is made up  of  different  classes  of  shares  (whether  before  or after  the  change in the issued share capital) or where the  change  consists  of  an  alteration  of  voting  rights, the  real  value  of  shares  held  in  the  company  shall, notwithstanding paragraph (i), be the percentage of the real  value  of  the  said  company  corresponding  to  the percentage  of  the  total  voting  rights  in  the  company represented by the total voting rights attached to those shares;
- (iii) notwithstanding paragraph (ii), where the value of "Y" as determined by the application of sub-paragraph (i) is  higher  than  the  value  of  "Y"  as  determined  by  the application of sub-paragraph (ii), the value of "Y" is to be determined by the application of sub-paragraph (i).

- (3) The real value of a company shall, for the purpose of subrule (2), be determined in accordance with rules 5(6) and (7) of the Capital Gains Rules, and references in the said sub-rules to "market value" shall be construed as references to "real value":

Provided that in determining the real value of the company, the total net asset value referred to in rule 5(6) of the said rules shall be that resulting from an accounting statement prepared by a certified public accountant holding a practicing certificate in auditing, to be drawn up as at the date of the deemed transfer of value.

- (5) The transferee in any transfer of value referred to in this rule shall submit to the Commissioner a computation of the real value of the shares, made on the forms or means as supplied by the Commissioner for this purpose, accompanied by the accounting statement referred to in sub-rule (3) and by an architect's valuation of the real value of the immovable property taken into account in determining the value of the company.
