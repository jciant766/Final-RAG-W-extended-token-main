3.

The indemnity limit shall be applicable to any one claim or to the aggregate of all claims made against the notary in any policy year.

For the purposes of this regulation, judicial and legal costs of whatever nature including those to defend a claim, and legal costs of whatever nature including, but not limited to, those relating to a compromise, shall be at the charge of the insurance provider and shall be deemed to be included in the indemnity limit:

Provided  that  nothing  in  this  regulation  shall  preclude  a notary from being insured for a higher sum than the indemnity limit, or for one or more "higher value transactions", under such terms and conditions agreed upon between the notary and the insurance provider:

Provided further that a policy shall not extend to any breach caused by a notary and, or the notary's employees, which is otherwise insured.

- (2) The indemnity limit shall be exclusive of the sum that may be agreed upon as excess to be paid by the notary on each and every claim under the terms of the policy:

Provided that for one or more claims against the policy in any policy year, a notary shall not accept to pay an excess that exceeds, with regard to each such claim, one point five per centum (1.5%) of the indemnity limit established in the policy:

Provided further that an insurance provider shall not demand the payment of an excess as a condition to effect payment of damages to a claimant, nor shall the insurance provider be entitled to deduct such excess from any payment made to a claimant.

- (3) ( a ) The notary shall disclose to the insurance provider his annual income from the exercise of his profession in the year immediately preceding the policy year. The insurance provider shall provide a policy based on such annual income:

Provided that  where a  notary  is  unable  to  disclose  to the insurance provider his exact annual income for the year immediately preceding the policy year in view of the fact that such preceding year has not yet ended, a

reasonable estimate shall suffice.

- ( b ) Where the notary's annual income for the year immediately preceding the policy year does not exceed twenty-five thousand euro (€25,000) or such other sum as  may  be  established  by  the  Minister  from  time  to time, the annual income for such preceding year shall be deemed to be twenty-five thousand euro (€25,000) or  such  other  sum  as  may  be  established  by  the Minister from time to time.
4. The notary shall also be required to be adequately covered by a policy against any breach which may have been committed by the notary and, or the notary's employees at any time within the five years immediately prior to the beginning of the policy year:

Provided  that  the  policy  need  not  extend  to  any  fact, possibly being a breach, occurring prior to 1 January 2013 which the notary may have known or suspected to have happened, and which the notary is obliged to disclose to the insurance provider prior to the commencement of the policy.

5. (1) A notary shall no longer be required to be covered in terms of regulation 3 in the instances mentioned in sub-regulation (4) of this regulation.

- (4) The  instances  referred  to  in  sub-regulation  (1)  are  the following:
5. ( a ) where the notary ceases from exercising his functions for any of the reasons mentioned in article 14(1) of the Act; or
6. ( b ) upon the issue of a decree in terms of regulation 9(3).
6. Where a policy is transferred from one insurance provider to another, the new policy shall extend to indemnify the notary against any loss or claim made against the assured notary for a retroactive cover of five years in respect of any breach which may have occurred, or is alleged to have occurred, prior to the inception of the new policy:

Provided  that  such  cover  need  not  extend  to  any  fact, possibly being a breach, occurring prior to 1 January 2013 which the notary may have known or suspected to have happened, and which the notary is obliged to disclose to the insurance provider prior to the commencement of the policy.

7. Where  the  insurance  provider  is  entitled  at  any  time  to avoid payment under a policy by reason of non-disclosure or misinterpretation of facts by the notary when he completed his

8. (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of article 94A(12)( a ) and (18) of the Act and other relevant articles thereof, every notary shall provide on an annual basis to the Notarial Council, through one of the review officers defined in article 94A(1) of the Act, a copy of the policy taken out in terms of the Act and these regulations for the sole purpose of ascertaining that the notary is validly and adequately covered in terms of the Act and these regulations.
- (2) In  the  event  of  doubt  as  to  whether  a  policy  is  valid  and adequate in terms of the Act and these regulations in relation to a notary, the Notarial Council shall, within one month of receiving such copy, determine, after consultation with an insurance broker or an independent insurance provider, whether the policy is so valid and adequate and, if it is not, a reasoned decision shall be communicated forthwith by registered mail to the notary concerned.
- (3) A notary to whom a reasoned decision has been communicated in terms of sub-regulation (2) shall address without delay any concern raised by the Notarial Council and shall also send by registered mail to the Council the necessary documentation to the satisfaction of the Council.

6. ( a ) indicate the reason why and the calendar year or years during which he does not intend publishing  any notarial act; and
7. ( b ) present a copy of his run-off cover policy valid for two years immediately following the end of the policy year in which he published his last notarial act:
8. Provided that  the  last  requisite  shall  not  apply  where the notary did not publish any notarial act in the five years prior to his application.
- (3) Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  sub-regulation  (2), the Court shall accede to the request of the notary, and issue the appropriate decree in the following cases:
10. ( a ) where the notary intends to absent himself from Malta for a period exceeding one year; or
11. ( b ) where  the  notary  is  suffering  from  ill-health  or  a protracted medical condition restricting  him  from publishing any notarial act; or

- (4) The  grant  of  a  decree  by  the  Court  in  any  of  the  cases mentioned in sub-regulation (3) shall not be interpreted as preventing a notary from publishing a notarial act at any time, so long as he first conforms to the provisions of the Act and these regulations with regard to insurance and also applies to the Court for the revocation of its decree with effect from the date when he is covered, or again covered, in terms of regulation 3.
