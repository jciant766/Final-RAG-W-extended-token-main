SECONDARY ACTIVITIES OF COMMERCIAL AGENTS
1. The activities of a person as a commercial agent are secondary where it may
reasonably be taken that the primary purpose of the arrangement with his principal is
other than as set out in paragraph 2 below.
2. An arrangement falls within this paragraph if -
(a) the business of the principal is the sale, or as the case may be purchase,
of goods or services of a particular kind; and
(b) the goods or services concerned are such that -
(i) transactions are normally individually negotiated and concluded
on a commercial basis, and
(ii) procuring a transaction on one occasion is likely to lead to further
transactions in those goods or services with that customer on
future occasions, or to transactions in those goods or services with
other customers in the same geographical area or among the same
group of customers, and that accordingly it is in the commercial
interests of the principal in developing the market in those goods
or services to appoint a representative to such customers with a
view to the representative devoting effort, skill and expenditure
from his own resources to that end.
3. The following are indications that an arrangement falls within paragraph 2
above, and the absence of any of them is indication to the contrary -
(a) the principal is the manufacturer, importer or distributor of the goods;
(b) the goods are specifically identified with the principal in the market in
question rather than, or to a greater extent than, with any other person;
(c) the agent devotes substantially the whole of his time to representative
activities (whether for one principal or for a number of principals whose
interests are not conflicting);
(d) the goods are not normally available in the market in question other
than by means of the agent;
(e) the arrangement is described as one of commercial agency.
4. The following are indications that an arrangement does not fall within
paragraph 2 above -
(a) promotional material is supplied direct to potential customers;
(b) persons are granted agencies without reference to existing agents in a
particular area or in relation to a particular group;
(c) customers normally select the goods for themselves and merely place
their orders through the agent.
5. The activities of the following categories of persons are presumed, unless

--- PAGE 116 ---
116 CAP. 13.] COMMERCIAL CODE
the contrary is established, not to fall within paragraph 2 above -
- Mail order catalogue agents for consumer goods;
- Consumer credit agents.
