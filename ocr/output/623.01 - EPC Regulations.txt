- (2) The Building and Construction Authority shall report to the Commission, at regular intervals, which shall not be longer than five years, all input data and assumptions used for such standards and the  results  thereof.  The  report  may  be  included  in  the  Energy Efficiency Action Plans (EEAP) referred to in regulation 24(2) of the Energy Efficiency and Cogeneration Regulations.
- (3) If the result of the comparison performed in accordance with sub-regulation (2) shows that the minimum energy performance requirements in force are significantly less energy efficient than costoptimal  levels  of  minimum  energy  performance  requirements,  the Building  and  Construction  Authority  shall  justify  this  difference  in writing to the Commission in the report referred to in sub-regulation (2).  Such  report  shall,  to  the  extent  that  the  difference  cannot  be justified,  be  accompanied  by  a  plan  outlining  appropriate  steps  to significantly reduce the difference by the next review of the energy

## Schedule I (Regulation 4)

## Common general framework for the calculation of energy performance of buildings

1. The energy performance of a building shall be determined on the basis of calculated or actual energy use and shall reflect  typical  energy  use  for  space  heating,  space  cooling,  domestic hot water, ventilation, lighting and other technical building systems.

The energy performance of a building shall be expressed by a numeric  indicator  of  primary  energy  use  in  kWh/(m 2 .y)  for  the purpose of both energy performance certification and compliance with minimum energy performance requirements. The methodology applied for the determination of the energy performance of a building shall be transparent and open to innovation.

The competent authority shall describe its national calculation methodology  following  the  national  annexes of  the  overarching standards,  namely  ISO  52000-1,  52003-1,  52010-1,  52016-1,  and 52018-1,  developed  under  mandate  M/480  given  to  the  European Committee  for Standardisation (CEN).  This provision shall not constitute a legal codification of those standards.

2. The  energy  needs  for  space  heating,  space  cooling, domestic hot water, ventilation, lighting and other technical building systems  shall  be  calculated  in  order  to  optimise  health,  indoor  air quality  and  comfort  levels  defined  by  the  competent  authority  at national or regional level.

The  calculation  of  primary  energy  shall  be  based  on  primary energy factors or weighting factors per energy carrier, which may be based on national, regional or local annual, and possibly also seasonal or monthly, weighted averages or on more specific information made available for individual district system.

Primary energy factors or weighting factors shall be defined by the  competent  authority.  In  the  application  of  those  factors  to  the calculation  of  energy  performance,  the  competent  authority  shall ensure that the optimal energy performance of the building envelope is pursued.

In the calculation of the primary energy factors for the purpose of  calculating  the  energy  performance  of  buildings,  the  competent authority  may  take  into  account  renewable  energy  sources  supplied through  the  energy  carrier  and  renewable  energy  sources  that  are generated  and  used  on-site,  provided  that  it  applies  on  a  nondiscriminatory basis.

3. For the purpose of expressing the energy performance of

- a  building,  the  competent  authority  may  define  additional  numeric indicators of total, non-renewable and renewable primary energy use, and of greenhouse gas emission produced in kgCO 2 eq/(m 2 .y).
4. The methodology shall be laid down taking into consideration at least the following aspects:
- (a) the following actual thermal characteristics of the building including its internal partitions:
- (i) thermal capacity;
- (ii) insulation;
- (iii) passive heating;
- (iv) cooling elements; and
- (v) thermal bridges;
- (b) heating installation and hot water supply, including their insulation characteristics;
- (c) air-conditioning installations;
- (d) natural  and  mechanical  ventilation  which  may include air-tightness;
- (e) built-in  lighting  installation  (mainly  in  the  nonresidential sector);
- (f) the  design,  positioning  and  orientation  of  the building, including outdoor climate;
- (g) passive solar systems and solar protection;
- (h) indoor climatic conditions, including the designed indoor climate;
- (i) internal loads.
5. The positive influence of the following aspects shall be taken into account:
- (a) local solar exposure conditions, active solar systems  and  other  heating  and  electricity  systems  based  on energy from renewable sources;
- (b) electricity produced by cogeneration;
- (c) district or block heating and cooling systems;
- (d) natural lighting.

6. For  the  purpose  of  the  calculation,  buildings  should  be adequately classified into the following categories:
2. (a) single-family houses of different types;
3. (b) apartment blocks;
4. (c) offices;
5. (d) educational buildings;
6. (e) hospitals;
7. (f) hotels and restaurants;
8. (g) sports facilities;
9. (h) wholesale and retail trade services buildings;
10. (i)other types of energy-consuming buildings.

## Schedule II (Regulation 32)

Independent control systems for energy performance certificates and inspection reports

1. The competent authority or bodies to which the competent authority has delegated the responsibility for implementing the independent control system shall make a random selection of all the energy performance certificates issued annually and subject them to  verification.  The  sample  shall  be  of  a  sufficient  size  to  ensure statistically significant compliance results.

The verification shall be based on the options indicated below or on equivalent measures:

- (a) validity  check  of  the  input  data  of  the  building used to issue the energy performance certificate and the results stated in the certificate;
- (b) check  of  the  input  data  and  verification  of  the results  of  the  energy  performance  certificate,  including  the recommendations made;
- (c) full check of the input data of the building used to issue the energy performance certificate, full verification of the results stated in the certificate, including the recommendations made,  and  on-site  visit  of  the  building,  if  possible,  to  check correspondence  between  specifications  given  in  the  energy

performance certificate and the building certified.

2. The competent authority or bodies to which the competent authority has delegated the responsibility for implementing the independent control systems shall make a random selection of at least a statistically significant percentage of all the inspection reports issued annually and subject those reports to verification.
3. Where  information  is  added  to  a  database  it  shall  be possible  for  national  authorities  to  identify  the  originator  of  the addition, for monitoring and verification purposes.".

## Schedule III (Regulation 6)

Comparative methodology framework to identify cost-optimal levels of  energy  performance  requirements  for  buildings and building elements

The comparative methodology framework shall enable Member States to determine the energy performance of buildings and building elements and the economic aspects of measures relating to the energy performance, and to link them with a view to identifying the cost-optimal level.

The comparative methodology framework shall be accompanied by guidelines outlining how to apply this framework in the calculation of cost-optimal performance levels. The comparative methodology  framework  shall  allow  for  taking  into  account  use patterns, outdoor  climate  conditions, investment  costs,  building category,  maintenance  and  operating  costs  (including  energy  costs and savings), earnings from energy produced, where applicable, and disposal  costs,  where  applicable.  It  should  be  based  on  relevant European standards relating to these regulations.

By  calculating  the  costs  of  the  energy  efficiency  measures during  the  expected  economic  life-cycle,  the  cost-effectiveness  of different  levels  of  minimum  energy  performance  requirements  is assessed by the Member States. This will allow the determination of cost-optimal levels of energy performance requirements.
