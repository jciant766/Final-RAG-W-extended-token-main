Provided  that  the  said  application  shall  be  appointed  for hearing within two weeks.

- (2) The  said  period  of  two  years  shall  be  reduced  to  four months from the date of service by a judicial act of a copy of the act of adjudication, or of a copy of the note of enrolment of the act of adjudication in the Public Registry, and this in respect only of any hypothecary or privileged creditor on whom such service is made.
- (3) Where the judicial  sale  is  of  a  commercial  going  concern that includes immovable property, the said period of two years shall be reduced to four months to commence to run from the date of enrolment of the act of adjudication in the Public Registry.
- (4) Any  action by the hypothecary  or privileged creditor against the third party in possession of an immovable acquired by virtue of a judicial sale shall be barred if the protest mentioned in article  2072(1)  of  the  Civil  Code,  (calling  upon  the  debtor  to discharge the debt and the third party in possession either to discharge the debt or to surrender the property), is not filed within the period of two years or four months mentioned in the preceding sub-articles  of  this  article,  or  if  the  creditor  fails  to  demand judicially the sale of the immovable within six months from the filing of the protest mentioned in article 2072(1) of the Civil Code. Such action shall also be barred if the third party in possession surrenders the property and the creditor fails to start proceedings for the judicial sale within six months from the service of a copy of

the note of such surrender.

- (5) Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  article  2072(2)  of  the Civil Code, the demand for the judicial sale of the immovable can be made at any time after the expiration of sixty days from the date of filing of the protest.

4. (7A) When such action is exercised and the sale is effected, the third party which has acquired possession of the immovable thing i n  whose  favour  the  property  would  have  been  originally adjudicated, who shall not also be the same person in whose favour during the second sale the property has been adjudicated, shall be paid from the proceeds of the second sale the sum of money which he would have defrayed together with all expenses made before any other creditor:

Provided  that  where  the  third  party  which  has  acquired possession of the immovable thing during the second sale at a higher price is also the same person in whose favour the property had been originally adjudicated, such third party shall be required to deposit in court only the difference in price, and not the full price.

- (9) The  court  shall  allow  the  demand  of  the  bidder  or  of  the purchaser; as the case may be, if it is satisfied that the omission in the said valuation or in the said list was relevant so as to affect the bid made by the purchaser.
357. The adjudication of immovable property as of itself constitutes an executive title and if either the debtor against whom execution is being sought or a third party occupying the premises without  title  fails  to  vacate  the  premises  so  adjudicated,  the purchaser shall be entitled, within one year from the adjudication, to seek the issue of a warrant of eviction on the basis of the said title of adjudication.

404. (1) The time mentioned in the last preceding article shall not exceed three months.
- (2) Such  time  shall  be  suspended  during  the  pendency  of  an application  to  sue  with  the  benefit  of  legal  aid,  provided  the application is filed by the jactitator within the first four days of the said time.
405. The court shall not allow the demand referred to in article 403 if the jactitation is in respect of an uncertain right, contingent upon any event or condition, or of a right with regard to which no action can, for the time being, be taken.
406. Any jactitator to whom a time has been fixed within which to bring his claim for trial, shall institute proceedings before the court  to  the  jurisdiction  of  which  the  party  aggrieved  by  the jactitation is subject.

413. Where  in  the  action  instituted  by  the  jactitator  the  court shall give judgment of non-suit against the jactitator, the time allowed under article 408, shall commence to run anew from the day on which the judgment of non-suit shall have become a res judicata but may not be enlarged.

## OF COMPETING CLAIMS

416. (1) If, in the superior courts or in the Court of Magistrates (Gozo) in its superior jurisdiction, there shall be deposited money in respect of which more than two parties allege claims of preference or priority or any other interest whatsoever, the court, upon the application of any of such claimants, shall, through the registrar, cause a notice to be published in one or more periodical newspapers, including in any case the Government Gazette, stating that the said money is standing in court, that there are claims upon such money, and calling upon all parties interested therein, to put in their respective claims within the time of one month, on the expiration of which it shall not be lawful for any party  failing  to  put  in  a  claim  within  that  time,  to  delay  or otherwise hinder the decision on the competition proceedings between the parties putting in a claim.

- (2) The  said  notice  shall  state  the  day  on  which,  after  the expiration of the said time of one month, all the parties interested who shall have put in a claim shall appear in court for the trial of the claims.
- (3) In  commercial matters, the time above referred to may be abridged  to  any  such  shorter  period  as  the  court  may  deem adequate.
- (4) The said notice shall be served on the persons making the deposit, the debtor, the execution creditors as well as on any other creditor at whose suit any garnishee order may have been issued.
417. The judgment given on the claims put in by the competing creditors within the prescribed time shall not operate so as to bar the exercise of any right on the part of any person who failed to put in his claim; and it shall be lawful for such person subsequently to recover, wholly or in part, from any ranked creditor the money received by him, if the claim of such person shall, on separate proceedings, prove to be prior, or equal to, that of the ranked creditor: but if it shall be proved that such person having a prior or an equal claim could have put in such claim within the prescribed time, his default may be taken into account in adjudging the costs.

418. Any person desiring to compete on the money deposited in court  shall,  within  the  prescribed  time,  file  an  application containing  his  demand  to  be  ranked  on  the  fund.  The  first competitor shall together with his application file a copy of the lodgment schedule.

The debtor, the person making the deposit and any other interested person appearing at the trial shall also be heard.
421. Where the court, for a further and better statement of the claims, in view of the intricacy of the issues involved, shall deem an additional written pleading to be necessary, the court may order such additional written pleading and make any other special order which it may consider expedient.
422. During the compilation of the competition proceedings, no money forming the subject-matter of such proceedings may be paid out without the consent of all the parties interested, unless the court,  with  a  view  to  avoiding  the  accruing  of  interest  to  the prejudice of all the parties, or for any other good reason, shall deem it  proper to satisfy the claim of any one of the competitors the priority or preference of which has not been contested.
423. Saving the provisions of articles 424, 425 and 427, if the competition refers to money deposited in court subject to the condition that it may not be withdrawn without a surety, such money or any part thereof shall not be paid out under any title or for any reason whatsoever without such surety.
424. Where  the  payment  out  is  demanded  by  a  government department,  or  any  administration  thereof,  or  by  any  pious institution or foundation, or any other body corporate, which can offer sufficient security on immovable property, the hypothecation of such immovable property made by a person lawfully authorised for the purpose, may be allowed in lieu of the surety referred to in the last preceding article.

- (ii) when a public authority has failed to observe the principles of natural justice or mandatory procedural requirements in performing the administrative  act  or  in  its  prior  deliberations thereon; or
- (iii) when the administrative act constitutes an abuse of the public authority's power in that it is done for improper purposes or on the basis of irrelevant considerations; or
- (iv) when the administrative act is otherwise contrary to law.

## (2) In this article -

"administrative act" includes the issuing by a public authority of any order, licence, permit, warrant, decision, or a refusal to any demand of a claimant, but does not include any measure intended for  internal  organization  or  administration  within  the  said authority:

Provided that, saving those cases where the law prescribes a period  within  which  a  public  authority  is  required  to  make  a decision, the absence of a decision of a public authority following a claimant's written demand served upon it, shall, after two months from such service, constitute a refusal for the purposes of this definition;

"public authority" means the Government of Malta, including its Ministries  and  departments,  local  authorities  and  any  body corporate  established  by  law  and  includes  Boards  which  are empowered in terms of law to issue warrants for the exercise of any trade or profession.

- (5) In  any  action  brought  under  this  article,  it  shall  be  lawful for the plaintiff to include in the demands a request for the payment of  damages  based  on  the  alleged  responsibility  of  the  public authority in tort or quasi tort, arising out of the administrative act. The  said  damages  shall  not  be  awarded  by  the  court  where notwithstanding the annulment of the administrative act the public authority has not acted in bad faith or unreasonably or where the thing requested by the plaintiff could have lawfully and reasonably been refused under any other power.
- (6) For the purposes of this article, and of any other provision of this and any other law, service with the government is a special relationship  regulated  by  the  legal  provisions  specifically

applicable to it and the terms and conditions from time to time established by the Government, and no law or provision thereof relating to conditions of employment or to contracts of service or of employment applies, or ever heretofore applied, to service with the government except to the extent that such law provides otherwise.

## 469B. (1) Where the Attorney General takes a decision:

- ( a ) not to prosecute in accordance with the  powers conferred upon him by any law; or
- ( b ) not to allow the inspection or the issuing of copies of a procès-verbal or of any depositions or documents filed therewith in terms of the proviso to article 518 of the Criminal Code,

the courts of justice of civil jurisdiction, giving due account to the constitutional independence of the Attorney General, may enquire into the validity of the said decision and declare such decision null, invalid or  without  effect  and  consequently  send  back  the  matter  to  the Attorney General for review in accordance with the judgment of the court only in the case of a finding that the decision is not properly directed on legal considerations or is unreasonable in that it is not open to a reasonable prosecutor.

- (2) An action for judicial review of a decision of the Attorney General as provided in paragraph (a) of sub-article (1) may be filed only by the injured party and an action in terms of paragraph (b) of sub-article (1) shall be filed by the claimant within two months from when the injured party or the claimant becomes aware or could have become aware of the decision, whichever is the earlier:

Provided  that  where  the  law  provides  for  a  procedure whereby the Attorney General may be requested to conduct an internal review of the decision, the said period of two months shall commence to run as from the date when the injured party is informed of the results of the said review:

Provided  further  that  for  the  purposes  of  this  article,  the Auditor General, the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life, the Permanent Commission Against Corruption and the Ombudsman shall be entitled to make any claim and to exercise any action which according to this article pertains to the injured party when they shall have reported any corrupt practice as defined in the Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act to the Attorney General.

- (3) Judicial review cannot be made where an agreement has been reached with the competent authorities of another country that the courts of that country shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime.

495. (1) The  provisions  of  the  foregoing  articles  shall  also apply where the demand contained in the application is for the substitution  of  some  immovable  property  for  other  property, whether movable or immovable, subject to a dividual entail.
- (2) In such case, the substitution may be authorized by a decree of the said court, even though the fruits of the property in regard to which the disentail is demanded, exceed the sum of ninety-three euro and seventeen cents (93.17) per annum .
496. It  shall  also  be  lawful  for  the  said  court  to  grant  to  any person in possession of property of any value whatsoever, subject to any dividual or individual entail, authorization to give such property on lease for any period exceeding eight years, in the case of rural property, or four years, in the case of urban property, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such lease would be for the benefit of the persons entitled to succeed:

Provided that the court may not grant any such authorization for a period exceeding twelve years, in the case of rural property, or eight years, in the case of urban property.

497. (1) It shall also be lawful for the said court to grant to any person in possession of property of any value whatsoever, subject to any dividual or individual entail, authorization to give such property on emphyteusis for a definite period or in perpetuity, provided the persons whose consent would, according to the provisions of article 490, be necessary for a disentail, give their consent thereto.
- (2) The  provisions  of  article  491  shall  also  apply  in  the  case referred to in this article.
498.

6. ( b ) ''mental disorder'' shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Mental Health Act:

2. ( a ) by any one of the spouses against the other spouse;
3. ( b ) by  any  person  against  another  related  to  him  by consanguinity;

5. ( d ) in case of a mental disorder or other condition, which renders  a  person  incapable  of  managing  his  own affairs, by the State Advocate; unless the demand shall have been made by any other person.

523. (1) If  the  court  finds  that  there  is  just  cause  for  the interdiction, it shall appoint a curator to administer the property of the person interdicted.

- (2) It shall also be lawful for the court, if it deems it necessary, to incapacitate any person from performing all or any of the acts of mere administration, entrusting the performance thereof to a curator in such manner as the court may deem fit to direct.

- (5) The  inclusion  of  the  notes  of  the  evidence  in  the  record shall not operate so as to bar any witness heard before the court below from being recalled before the appellate court either by the parties or upon an order of the court ex officio.

- (2) No other pleas can be set up at a later stage; provided that the court may on an application by the defendant or respondent allow the setting up of additional pleas, if it is satisfied that there were valid reasons for not including them in the note of pleas or in the answer.

729. If the court deems it expedient, before proceeding further, to deal with the dilatory plea, the court may hear the merits so far as the same may affect the decision on the preliminary issue.
730. Any plea to the jurisdiction of the court or to the capacity of  the  parties,  and  any  plea  of  compromise,  arbitration, res judicata , prescription, or nullity of acts, shall be determined under a separate head, either before, or together with the decision on the merits.
731. The provisions of article 728 shall not apply to such pleas as by an express provision of this Code may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, or to pleas the reason for which arises during the trial.
732. (1) Saving always the provisions of this Code respecting the production of evidence, peremptory pleas may be raised even before the appellate court although they may not have been raised before the court of first instance.
- (2) Nevertheless,  the  plea  of  desertion  of  a  cause  shall  be deemed to  have  been  waived,  if  not  raised  before  any  other peremptory plea.
6. 732A. Saving the provisions of any other law, in those instances where the  law  allows  the  court  to  raise ex  officio a  plea  in  a judgment without raising such plea prior to the action being put off for judgment, without allowing the parties to take cognizance of such plea before judgment is delivered, and without the parties being allowed to produce such evidence or plead in relation to the plea, the court shall not raise such a plea in its judgment but shall raise such a plea in open court or by decree in  camera and  the parties  shall  be  allowed  to  produce  evidence  and  make  oral submissions thereupon before judgment on the plea raised by the court is delivered.

- ( b ) if the applicant  fails  to  bring  forward  his  claim, whether  before  the  arbitrator  or  before  the  court, within the said time limit of twenty days; or
- ( c ) on the expiration of the duration, original or extended, of the particular act in terms of this Code; or
- ( d ) for  just  cause  on  the  application  of  the  debtor  as  the court may deem proper in the circumstances.
- (6) Where  provision  is  made  under  any  other  law,  or,  in  any regulation of the European Union making provision different from that contained in this article, the provisions of this article shall not apply with regard to the matters covered by such other provision and shall only apply to matters to which such other provision does not apply.

809. The banns for the appointment of curators shall be served on the presumptive heir or heirs, if known; and if unknown such banns shall be published twice, in at least two daily newspapers, at an interval of one week between such publications, at the expense of the applicant without the need of any notification.

810B. Where, within six months from the death pendente lite of any  party  to  a  suit,  no  application  is  made  by  any  person  to continue the suit in substitution of the deceased party or where during the said time no application has been filed by a party to the suit  demanding  that  the  suit  be  continued  in  the  name  of  the presumptive heir or heirs of the deceased party, the suit shall continue in the name of the deceased party and any judgement delivered in such suit shall be enforceable against the heirs of the said deceased party:

Provided  that  notwithstanding  the  lapse  of  the  six  month period stipulated in this article, any interested person as referred to in article 806 and the other party as referred to in article 807 may, until such time when the suit is adjourned for judgement or after judgement  in  the  case  that  the  said  person  or  party  files  an application of appeal, avail himself of the provisions of the said articles 806 or 807 respectively:

Provided further that no judgement delivered in respect of a deceased party shall be deemed to be null or defective only by reason of the fact that the period of six months referred to in this article had not lapsed at the time when the suit was adjourned for judgement.

- ( b ) Notwithstanding that a deposit is  made  or  security  is given  as  aforesaid,  the  time  limits  established  in  this Title  on  the  creditor  to  bring  forward  his  action  shall continue to apply.
- ( c ) Such time limits shall run from the date of the issue of the  precautionary  act,  and  failure  by  the  creditor  to institute  proceedings  within  the  said  time  limits  shall entitle the debtor to withdraw the deposit or cancel the security.

831. (1) The demand for the issue of any of the said acts shall be  made  by  an  application  prepared  by  the  applicant  and containing, under pain of nullity of the act, other than further details which may be prescribed by regulations:

8. ( d ) Any court receiving any application by the owner of an aircraft in terms of this sub-article shall immediately  order  its  service  upon  the  owner  of  the engine and rule on any such application expeditiously and  within  a  maximum  period  of  two  working  days

898. The  protest  referred  to  in  the  last  preceding  article  shall not operate so as to suspend the running of the time prescribed for the filing of any written pleading.

899. Where  the  time  allowed  for  the  filing  of  any  written pleading has been enlarged or where contumacy has been cleared, the time within which objection to the security for costs may be taken as provided in article 897 shall in no case be deemed to be thereby enlarged or granted anew.

902. (1) Where objection to the security for costs is taken after the  cause  is  set  down  on  the  list  for  hearing,  or  where  such objection is notified less than two days before the cause is so set down, the party giving the security may, on the day appointed for the hearing, demand orally that he be allowed to prove, before the commencement of the hearing, the sufficiency of the surety.
- (2) Where  the  time  for  taking  objection  to  the  surety  expires after the cause is set down on the list for hearing, the objection may be taken orally before the commencement of the hearing, and in such case the party giving the security may demand that he be allowed  the  time  of  at  least  two  days  in  order  to  prove  the sufficiency of the surety.
- (3) In either case, failing such proof, the provisions contained in articles 200 to 209 inclusive, shall be observed.
903. Where objection to the security for costs is taken by the registrar, such objection shall be made by a protest within the time referred to in articles 897 and 900:

Provided  that  where  the  cause  has  been  suspended  until judgment is pronounced in another cause, the said time shall commence to run from the date when such judgment is delivered.
