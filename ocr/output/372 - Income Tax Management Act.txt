## PART III

## Persons Assessable

5. (1) Further  to  the  provisions  contained  in  Part  IX  of  the Income Tax Act, a person not resident in Malta (hereinafter in this Act referred to as "a non-resident person") shall be assessable and chargeable in the name of his trustee, guardian, tutor, curator or committee, or of any attorney, factor, agent, receiver, branch or manager, whether such attorney, factor, agent, receiver, branch or manager has the receipt of the income or not, in like manner and to the like amount as such non-resident person would be assessed and charged to tax in Malta as if he were in the actual receipt of such income.

A non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable in respect of any income arising, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any attorneyship, factorship, agency, receivership, branch or management, and shall be so assessable and chargeable in the name of the attorney, factor, agent, receiver, branch or manager.

- (2) Where the registered holder of a share holds such share for the benefit of another person, the Commissioner shall be entitled to treat such registered holder as beneficially entitled to such share except as provided in sub-article (3).

- (3) Where  the  registered  holder  of  a  share  had  been  licensed under article 51A of the Malta Financial Services Authority Act and  until  such  time  that  he  is  so  licensed  or  is  authorised  or otherwise permitted to act as a trustee under article 43 or 43A of the Trusts and Trustees Act, a central securities depository authorised under article 24 of the Financial Markets Act or is licensed under the Investment Services Act, to carry out activities within paragraph 4 of the First Schedule to that Act and provides the Commissioner with a certificate in writing that he holds the share for the benefit of a person or persons all of whom are not resident in Malta within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts, the Commissioner shall not treat the registered holder of the share as beneficially entitled to it:

Provided  that this sub-article shall  only  apply  where  the certificate  referred  to  herein  includes  the  names  and  taxpayer identification numbers of the person or persons for the benefit of which the share is held and of their ultimate beneficial owners, and any other details as the Commissioner may require.

- (4) A  person  referred  to  in  sub-article  (3)  who  issues  a  false certificate to the Commissioner shall be guilty of making a false statement within the meaning of article 52(1)( b ).
- (5) The  master  of  any  ship  owned  or  chartered  by  a  nonresident person who is chargeable under article 28 of the Income Tax Act shall (though not to the exclusion of any other agent) be deemed the agent of such non-resident person for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.
- (6) Where  a  non-resident  person  carried  on  business  with  a resident person, and it appears to the Commissioner that, owing to the close connection between the resident person and the nonresident person and to the substantial control exercised by the nonresident person over the resident person, the course of business between those persons can be so arranged and is so arranged that the  business  done  by  the  resident  person  in  pursuance  of  his connection with the non-resident person produces to the resident person either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise from the business, the non-resident person shall be assessable and chargeable to tax in the name of the resident person as if the resident person were an agent of the nonresident person.
- (7) Where it appears to the Commissioner that the true amount of the gains or profits of any non-resident person chargeable to tax in the name of a resident person cannot in any individual case be readily ascertained, the Commissioner may, if he thinks fit, assess and  charge  the  non-resident  person  on  a  fair  and  reasonable percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non-resident person through or with the resident person in whose name he is chargeable as aforesaid and in such case the provisions of the Income Tax Acts as to the delivery of returns or particulars by persons acting on behalf of others shall extend so as to require returns or particulars to be furnished by the resident person of the business so done by the non-resident person through or with the resident person, in the same manner as returns or particulars are to be delivered by persons acting for incapacitated or non-resident

persons in respect of income to be charged:

Provided  that  the  amount  of  the  percentage  shall  in  each case be determined having regard to the nature of the business and shall, when determined by the Commissioner, be subject to an appeal as provided by articles 35 and 37.

- (8) Nothing  in  this  article  shall  render  a  non-resident  person chargeable in the name of a broker or general commission agent or other agent where such broker, general commission agent or agent is not an authorised person carrying on the regular agency of the non-resident person, or a person chargeable as if he were an agent in pursuance of sub-articles (5), (6) and (7), in respect of gains or profits arising from sales or transactions carried out through such a broker or agent.
- (9) The fact that a non-resident person executes sales or carries out transactions with other non-residents in circumstances which would make him chargeable in pursuance of sub-articles (5) and (6) in  the  name  of  a  resident  person  shall  not  of  itself  make  him chargeable in respect of gains or profits arising from those sales or transactions.
- (10) Where  a  non-resident  person  is  chargeable  to  tax  in  the name of any attorney, factor, agent, receiver, branch or manager in respect of any gains or profits arising from the sale of goods or produce manufactured or produced out of Malta by the non-resident person, the person in whose name the non-resident person is so chargeable may, if he thinks fit, apply to the Commissioner to have the assessment to tax in respect of those gains or profits made or amended on the basis of the profits which might reasonably be expected to have been earned by a merchant or, where the goods are retailed by or on behalf of the manufacturer or producer, by a retailer of the goods sold, who had bought from the manufacturer or producer  direct,  and,  on  the  proof  to  the  satisfaction  of  the Commissioner of the amount of the profits on the basis aforesaid, the assessment shall be made or amended accordingly.
- (11) A non-resident person shall not, by virtue of this article, be assessable or chargeable to tax in the name of an agent or other representative in respect of gains or profits arising to the nonresident person resulting from the provision in Malta by the agent or such other representative of any of the services listed in the First Schedule to the Investment Services Act, provided that:
5. ( a ) the  investment  services  concerned  are  carried  out  in the ordinary course of such business; and
6. ( b ) the remuneration which the agent or other representative receives for the provision of investment services to the non-resident person is at a rate which is not less than that which is customary for that class of business, and in the case of an agent or other representative  who  provides  investment  services  as part  only  of  a  business,  the  provisions  of  paragraphs ( a )  and  ( b )  shall  apply  as  if  that  part  were  a  separate business.

- (12) For  the  purposes  of  sub-article  (11)  an  agent  or  other representative shall be deemed to have carried out an investment service  on  behalf  of  his  principal  whether  he  undertakes  the transaction himself or gives instructions to another person.
- (13) The activities of the agent or other representative shall not affect the residence of the non-resident person for tax purposes.
6. The  person in whose  name  a  non-resident person is chargeable, shall be answerable for all matters required to be done by virtue of the Income Tax Acts for the assessment of the income of any person for whom he acts and for paying the tax chargeable thereon.
7. (1) The manager or other principal officer of every body of persons shall be answerable for doing all such acts, matters and things as are required to be done by virtue of the Income Tax Acts for the assessment of such body and payment of the tax.
- (2) Every  such  principal  officer  shall  pay  the  tax  out  of  the property of the body of persons. He shall, however, be liable for payment personally, and jointly and severally with any other person responsible therefor, if at any time after 1st January, 1979 he had in his possession or control any property belonging to the body of persons which could have been used to pay the tax then due.
- (3) The liquidator of a company which is being wound up shall not distribute any of the assets of the company to its shareholders unless he had made provision, in so far as he is able to do so out of the assets of the company, for the payment in full of any tax which he  knows of or might reasonably expect to be payable by the company under the Income Tax Acts and in default, such liquidator shall be liable personally, and jointly and severally with any other person responsible therefor, for payment of the tax due:

Provided that this sub-article shall not apply to an official receiver, or any other person, appointed in accordance with the provisions of article 225 of the Companies Act.

8. Every person who in whatever capacity is in receipt of any money or value being income arising from any of the sources mentioned in the Income Tax Acts or belonging to any person who is chargeable in respect thereof, or who would be so chargeable if he were resident in Malta and not an incapacitated person, shall whenever required to do so by any notice from the Commissioner, prepare and deliver within the period mentioned in such notice a list signed by him containing -
2. ( a ) a true and correct statement of such income; and
3. ( b ) the  name  and  address  of  every  person  to  whom  the same shall belong,

- (3) Where it appears to the Commissioner that a person has not been assessed or has been assessed at a lesser amount than that which ought to have been charged for any year of assessment preceding the year of assessment 1999, the Commissioner may assess  such  person  at  such  amount  or  additional  amount  as, according to his judgement, ought to have been charged and the provisions of sub-article (1)( b ) shall apply to such an assessment.
- (4) An assessment for a year of assessment made pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions of this article shall be made within that year of assessment or within eight years after the expiration thereof:

Provided that in cases where there has not yet been a final decision or a final judgement, the notification of an assessment to the taxpayer after the expiration of the periods specified in this sub-

Provided further that where such notification is not made by the 31st December, 2007 because the taxpayer could not be found or for other reasons attributable to him, such assessment shall be deemed to have been duly notified if, not later than 31st December 2008, the Commissioner publishes a notice in the Gazette and in one or more daily newspapers stating that such assessment has been made and inviting the taxpayer to call for it at the Department.

2. (3A) Where  an  estimate  has  been  made  in  the  circumstances mentioned in sub-article (3) and the return has still not been delivered, the Commissioner may make an assessment under the provisions of sub-article (5) on the person concerned, without the need to have previously notified the said person that an enquiry is being conducted into his tax declarations and liabilities.

Provided further that the provisions of the immediately preceding  proviso  shall  during  the  period  1  January 2011  to  31  December  2014  also  apply  in  the  case  of any  profits  distributed  by  a  company  which  was  an international trading company as at 31 December 2010 where  such  profits  were  earned  by  such  company while it was an international trading company.
