Provided  also  that  if  more  than  one  individual  holds, directly or indirectly, less than twenty percent of the nominal share capital and voting rights in only one of the said companies, the previous proviso shall not apply where together such individuals hold, directly or

indirectly, twenty percent or more of the nominal share capital and voting rights in that company:

- a ) If a company ("the chargeable company") holds shares in a company, which had been acquired from another company, and such acquisition was exempt from tax under sub-article (9), this sub-article shall apply if the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the original group before the lapse of six years from the date of the said acquisition. References in this subarticle to a company ceasing to be a member of a group do not apply to cases where a company ceases to be a member of the original group by being wound up or dissolved or in consequence of another member of the original group being wound up or dissolved:

Provided that where a company ceases to be a member of the original group by being wound up or dissolved, for the purpose of determining whether the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the original group under paragraph ( b ), such company shall be deemed to have remained in existence.

- ( b ) The chargeable company shall cease to be a member of the original group, if such company and the company from  which  it  had  acquired  the  shares  referred  to  in paragraph ( a )  no longer satisfy the provisions of subarticle (9)(i) and (iii) and such determination shall be made by reference to the same individuals referred to in  paragraph  (iii)  of  the  said  sub-article  taken  into account  in  determining  whether  the  two  companies referred to in this paragraph satisfied the provisions of sub-article (9)(i) and (iii) on the date of the acquisition referred to in paragraph ( a ):

Provided  that  where  the  acquisition  referred  to  in paragraph ( a ) took place before the 1st January 2010, sub-article (9)(iii) shall be disregarded for the purpose of  determining  whether  a  company  ceases  to  be  a member of a group:

Provided  further  that  where  the  chargeable  company ceases to be a member of the original group, solely as a result of a change in the direct or indirect individual shareholders of the company  from  which it  had acquired  the  shares  referred  to  in  paragraph  ( a ),  the chargeable  company  shall,  for  the  purpose  of  this paragraph, not be treated as ceasing to be a member of the  original  group  as  a  result  of  such  change,  so however that  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the original group it shall be deemed that such change had not taken place and such determination shall be made by reference to the same individuals referred to in subarticle (9)(iii) taken into account in determining whether  the  chargeable  company  and  the  company from  which  it  had  acquired  the  shares  satisfied  the provisions of sub-article (9)(i) and (iii) on the date of the acquisition referred to in paragraph ( a ).

- ( c ) For  the  purpose  of  this  sub-article  the  term  "original group"  shall  mean  the  two  companies  referred  to  in paragraph  ( b ),  and  the  individual  direct  or  indirect beneficial  owners  of  the  said  companies  who  were taken into account in determining whether the provisions  of  sub-article  (9)(i)  and  (iii)  had  been satisfied  on  the  date  of  the  acquisition  referred  to  in paragraph ( a ):

Provided that where the two companies referred to in this  paragraph  are  directly  or  indirectly  owned  as  to eighty percent or more by a company whose securities are  listed  on  a  stock  exchange  recognised  by  the Commissioner for the purpose of this provision the term "original group" shall mean the two companies referred  to  above  and  the  company  whose  securities are listed on the said stock exchange as existing on the date of the acquisition referred to in the paragraph ( a ):

Provided  further  that  where  an  individual  acquires shares  in  terms  of  a  donation  exempt  from  tax  under the provisions of sub-article (2)( e ), or a transfer causa mortis ,  such  individual  shall  be  deemed  for  all  the purposes  of  this  sub-article  to  have  held  such  shares from the date such shares were previously acquired in an acquisition preceding the date of the donation or the

- transfer causa mortis .
- ( d ) When the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the group it shall be treated for all the purposes of this  article  as  if,  immediately  after  its  acquisition  of the shares referred to in paragraph ( a ), it had

- transferred  and  immediately  re-acquired  the  shares  at that time.
- ( e ) The base cost and the date of acquisition of the shares that is taken into account for the purpose of determining any gain or loss shall be the original cost and the date when the shares had previously last been acquired by a company by means of a transfer that did not qualify for an exemption in terms of sub-article (9) or by means of an allotment, which ever is the later.

- (i) For  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  gains  or profits arising under this sub-article, the acquisition  cost  of  shares  acquired  before  the 25th November, 1992 shall be valued either on the Equity method of share valuation (net asset value)  based  on  the  last  accounts  submitted  to the  Commissioner by the 18th December, 1992 or on the actual purchase price, whichever is the higher.
- (ii) Shares  acquired  on  or  after  the  25th  November 1992, shall be valued on the cost of acquisition:

Provided that where an amount standing to the credit of  any  of  a  company's  reserve  accounts  other  than  a capital  redemption  reserve  and  profits  available  for distribution, is applied in paying up to any extent any shares allotted by the company, the cost of acquisition of such shares shall be zero.

- ( g ) Any  gain or loss on the transfer referred to in paragraph  ( d ) shall be  treated  as  accruing  to  the chargeable company immediately before the company ceases to be a member of the group in accordance with paragraph ( b ).

For  the  purpose  of  this  paragraph  a company  is  treated  as  indirectly  owning  immovable property if it holds, directly or indirectly, shares or other interests in any entity or person, which owns immovable property  situated  in  Malta  or  any  real  rights  thereon where five percent or more of the total value of the said shares  or  other  interests  so  held  is  attributable  to  such immovable property or rights.
- ( i ) Where in accordance with paragraph ( d ) the chargeable  company  is  treated  as  having  transferred and immediately reacquired the shares, and a chargeable gain or a capital loss accrues to the

chargeable company  on the deemed  transfer, the chargeable gain or capital loss accruing on the deemed transfer shall be treated as accruing not to the chargeable company but to a related company ("company A") if -

- (i) at the time of accrual, company A was incorporated in Malta, and
- (ii) a joint election under this paragraph is made by the chargeable company and company A to treat the chargeable gain or capital loss as accruing to company A, and
- (iii) such joint election is made by notice given to the Commissioner not later than twelve months after the end of the accounting period of the chargeable  company  or  company A  (whichever is  the  earlier)  in  which  the  time  of  accrual  fell, and
- (iv) provisional tax payable in accordance with article 43 of the Income Tax Management Act, is paid  by  company  A  at  a  rate  of  thirty-five percent of the market value of the shares deemed transferred  within  the  period  prescribed  in  the said article.

For the purpose of this paragraph company A is related to  the  chargeable  company  if  both  companies  form  a group for the purposes of sub-article (9) at the time of accrual and "time of accrual" means the time at which, by virtue of paragraph ( d ), the gain or loss is treated as accruing to the chargeable company.

- (10) ( a ) A capital loss shall be computed in the same manner as a capital gain.
2. ( b ) Any loss resulting from the transactions falling under sub-article (1) shall not be set off against other income for the year of assessment but shall be carried forward and  set  off  against  capital  gains  in  respect  of subsequent years of assessment until the full loss is absorbed.
3. ( c ) Bad debts incurred in relation to the said transactions proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have become bad during the year immediately preceding the year of assessment, notwithstanding that such bad debts were due a n d payable prior t o t h e commencement of the said year, shall be allowed as a deduction against the capital gains in the year in which they were incurred and if there are no gains for that year shall be carried forward and set off against future gains:

Provided  that  all  sums  recovered  in  respect  of  amounts previously allowed as bad debts shall be treated as gains for the purposes of this article and charged accordingly for the year in

4. ( c ) the  person  making  the  appraisement  or  valuation  on behalf  of  the  Commissioner  shall  for  the  purpose  of carrying out the task so entrusted to him be deemed to be a person serving in the Department of the Commissioner  and  as  having  an  official  duty  under this Act.
- (13) ( a ) Where a person transfers an asset which, at the time of acquisition, formed an undivided part of a larger asset (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as "the whole asset"), the deductions allowable in ascertaining the gain arising from that transfer shall be equivalent to such proportion of the cost of acquisition of the whole asset and of the other deductions that would be due in terms of this article had that person transferred the whole asset, as the consideration for the transfer bears at the time of the transfer to the market value of the whole asset.
6. ( b ) (i) A  reduction  of  the  share  capital  of  a  company shall be deemed  to be a transfer of such proportion  of  the  holding  of  the  owner  as  is equal  to  the  proportion  of  the  reduction  of  the capital  of  the  company  and  shall  constitute  a gain or loss for the purpose of this article in the year in which such reduction is effected:

Provided  that  where  there  is  a  proportionate reduction in the shareholding of all the shareholders,  such  that  the  proportion  of  the shareholding of each shareholder with respect to number,  type,  class,  voting  rights  and  value  of shares is equal before and after the reduction is effected, it shall be deemed that no loss or gain has arisen from the transfer.

- (ii) Where  the  market  value  of  shares  held  by  a person ("the transferor") in a company has been reduced  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  the  issued share  capital  of  such  company,  or  a  change  in voting  rights  attached  to  such  shares,  and  such value  passes  into  other  shares  in  or  rights  over the  company  held  by  any  other  person  ("the

transferee"),  the  transferor  shall  be  deemed  to have made a transfer of such value so reduced to the  transferee.  Any  gains  or  profits  shall  be calculated by taking into account the difference between  the  market  value  of  the  shares  held immediately before and after the said change:

Provided  that  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply where the change in the issued share capital or change  in  voting  rights  does  not  produce  any change in the individual direct or indirect beneficial owners of the said company and in the proportion  in  the  value  of  the  said  company represented  by  the  shares  owned  beneficially directly or indirectly by each such individual:

Provided  further  that  this  paragraph  shall  not apply  where  the  change  in  the  issued  share capital  consists  of  an  allotment  of  shares  in  a company as a result of an exchange of shares on a  restructuring  of  holdings  exempt  from  tax under the provisions of sub-article (14):

Provided also that this paragraph shall not apply where  the  said  company  is  a  company  whose securities are listed on a stock exchange recognised  by  the  Commissioner  for  the  purpose of this provision:

Provided also that this paragraph shall not apply where  the  transfer  of  value  is  made  by  the transferor  to  a  person  referred  to  in  sub-article (2)( e )(i):

Provided also that this paragraph shall not apply where  the  said  company  is  not  a  "property company" and it can be shown to the satisfaction of  the  Commissioner  that  the  said  change  is effected  for bona  fide commercial  reasons  and does not form part of a scheme or arrangements of  which  the  main  purpose,  or  one  of  the  main purposes is avoidance of liability to tax. For the purpose of this paragraph the proviso to the definition  of  ''property  company"  in  article  2(1) shall not apply.

For  the  purposes  of  this  sub-article "taxable trust property" means property referred to in sub-article (1)( a ):

Provided that this phrase includes only such property, the transfer of which, had it been carried out directly by the relevant beneficiary, would have given rise to gains or profits chargeable to tax in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

- ( b ) The  gain  or  profit  arising  from  the  transfer  of  the beneficial interest in a trust which has taxable trust property shall be equal to the consideration for the said beneficial interest as declared in the relevant transfer instrument. No deductions shall be allowable against the consideration payable to the transferor.
- ( c ) The  gain  or  profit  that  is  determined  in  accordance with paragraph ( b ) shall be taxable at the rate specified in article 56(6). No relief, reduction, credit or set-off of any kind shall be made in respect of such tax.

- ( g ) Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Sub-Title  VII  of Title VI of Part II of Book Second of the Civil Code, any  transfer  of  a  beneficial  interest  in  a  trust  which includes taxable trust property shall not take place and shall not have any effects for the purposes of any law unless the said transfer is made by means of a transfer instrument  and  unless  the  transferor  and  the  trustee have fulfilled their obligations in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs ( d ) and ( e ).
- ( h ) Subject to the provisions of article 10A of the Income Tax  Management  Act,  the  person  transferring the beneficial  interest  in  a  trust  which  includes  taxable trust  property  shall  not  be  obliged  to  disclose  the existence of such gains or profits in any return made pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Acts and no further tax shall be payable on such gains or profits.
- ( i ) The provisions of this article shall not apply -
- (i) where  the  Commissioner  is  satisfied  that  an irrevocable  disclaimer  of  a  beneficial  interest was not effected with the sole or main purpose of  avoiding,  reducing  or  postponing  liability  to tax and where he has, at his discretion, ordered in  writing  that  the  provisions  of  this  article  are not applicable to such a disclaimer;
- (ii) to  any  transfer  of  beneficial  interest  in  a  trust where  the  trustee  holds  property  solely  for  the purpose of a designated commercial transaction as defined in sub-article (24).
- (20) ( a ) Where,  in  the  administration  of  a  trust,  the  trustee t r a n s f e r s  p r o p e r t y  o f  s u c h  t r u s t ,  g a i n s  s h a l l  b e ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this article and the cost of acquisition shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs ( b ) and ( c ).

articles  (18)  and  (24)  where  the  settlor  is  also  a beneficiary of the trust , the cost of acquisition shall be equal to the cost of acquisition of such property at the time it was originally acquired by the settlor of such trust.  Where  the  property  had  been  settled  in  the circumstances described in sub-article (18)( a ) or subarticle (24)( a ), it shall be deemed for the purposes of this article that the settlor has directly transferred such property.

- ( c ) Subject to the provisions of paragraph ( b ),  the cost of acquisition shall be the cost of acquisition at the time when such property was first acquired as trust property of that trust whether by way of settlement or otherwise.
- ( a ) For the purposes of this article, property is distributed to beneficiaries of a trust when the trustee transfers property of a trust to any beneficiary of such trust provided  that  such  transfer  does  not  constitute  a reversion of property settled on trust as defined in subarticle (22)( a ).
- ( b ) Where  property  which  had  been  settled  on  trust  is distributed to the beneficiaries it shall be deemed that for the purpose of this article -
- (i) no  transfer  took  place  in  the  case  where  such property  had  been  settled  in  the  circumstances described in sub-article (18)( b ) provided that the property  was  distributed  to  beneficiaries  which were not settlors of the trust;
- (ii) property  distributed  to  persons  referred  to  in sub-article (2)( e )(i) in relation to the settlor, was donated directly by the settlor to such beneficiaries where such property had  been settled  in  the  circumstances  described  in  subarticle (18)( c );
- (iii) notwithstanding the relevant deeming provisions of  sub-article  (18),  such  property  was  donated directly by the original settlor of that property to such beneficiaries where such property had been settled  in  the  circumstances  described  in  subarticle  (18)( b )  and  ( c )  and  was  subsequently distributed to a beneficiary  that  was  also  a settlor of such trust: Provided  that  the  said  beneficiary  is  a  person referred  to  in  sub-article  (2)( e )(i)  in  relation  to the  said  original  settlor  who  had  owned  such property prior to its settlement in trust.
- ( c ) The provisions of sub-article (20) shall apply mutatis mutandis in  the  circumstances  of  a  distribution  of property as they apply to the transfer of property in the administration of a property of a trust.
- (22) ( a ) For the purpose of this article, property settled on trust

reverts where there is a transfer to a person who is the settlor  of  a  trust  (even  where  such  person  is  a beneficiary of that same trust) of property which had, immediately before its settlement into such trust, been owned by that same settlor.

- ( b ) Where property which had been settled in trust in the circumstances described in sub-article (18) reverts back  to  the  settlor,  notwithstanding  the  relevant deeming provisions of sub-article (18) , it  shall  be deemed for  the  purposes  of  this  article  that  such property had never been settled into such trust.
- ( c ) Where property had been settled into trust in circumstances other than those described in paragraph ( b ), and where such property reverts back to the settlor for the reasons referred to in article 16 of the Trusts and Trustees Act, it shall be deemed for the purpose of this article that no loss or gain had arisen in the event of such reversion.
- ( d ) The provisions of sub-article (20) shall apply mutatis mutandis i n  t h e  c i r c u m s t a n c e s  o f  a  r e v e r s i o n  o f property settled on trust as they apply to the transfer of property in the administration of a property of a trust.
- (23) In the case of a subsequent transfer of property by a settlor or beneficiary, as the case may be -
- ( a ) where such property had reverted to such settlor; or
- ( b ) where such property was distributed to the beneficiaries, and where -
- (i) such  distribution  was  deemed,  in  accordance with the provisions of this article, to be a direct donation from the settlor of the trust to the said beneficiaries of such trust; and
- (ii) such property is transferred by such beneficiaries  within  the  period  of  time  referred to  in  sub-article  (2)( f )  from  the  date  of  such deemed donation;

capital gains shall be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this article by taking into account the cost of acquisition of such property at the time it was originally acquired by the settlor of the trust before the relevant settlement.

- (24) ( a ) No  transfer  of  the  property  shall  be  deemed  to  have taken place -
2. (i) on the settlement of property consisting of shares  in  one  company  when  the  settlor  who owned  the  said  shares  prior  to  the  settlement thereof on trust is also the sole beneficiary of the trust;
3. (ii) on the settlement of property consisting of shares  in  one  company  when  the  settlement  is made  by  more  than  one  settlor,  and  the  said

Subsequent transfers by settlors or beneficiaries.

Transfers involving changes in trustees and particular commercial reasons.

Cap. 331.

- settlors  are  the  only  beneficiaries  of  the  trust, and  the  beneficiaries  are  entitled  to  benefit  in accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  trust  in  the same  proportion  as  they  would  have  done  as settlors;
- (iii) on  the  reversion  to  the  settlors  of  the  shares referred  to  in  subparagraphs  (i)  and  (ii)  in  the same  proportion  which  the  settlors  would  have been entitled to when the property was owned by them as settlors immediately prior to the settlement;
- (iv) upon  the  transfer  of  shares  in  one  company purchased  by  a  trustee  with  money  settled  in trust  by  a  settlor  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring, purchasing or subscribing to such shares, when the said transfer is made to the sole beneficiary of the trust who is also the original settlor;

and in each case, the trustee is a person authorised or not required to be so authorised to act as a trustee in terms of articles 43 and 43A of the Trusts and Trustees Act.

- ( b ) No transfer of the property of a trust shall be deemed to  have  taken  place  where  the  trustee  of  such  trust transfers all the property of such trust, which transfer involves only a change in the trustee of such trust and there  is  no  change  in  the  beneficiaries  or  in  the beneficial interest.
- ( c ) No loss or gain shall be deemed to have arisen where property  is  settled  into  a  trust  and  where  the  trustee holds  such  property  for  the  purpose  of  designated commercial  transactions  or  where  such  property  so settled  reverts  to  the  settlor.  Where  such  property  is transferred by the trustee of such trust to its beneficiaries (or to any person through a judicial sale or otherwise), the cost of acquisition shall be the cost at which the settlor of such trust had acquired the said property. In such a case, the provisions of sub-article (10)  can  be  availed  of  by  the  settlor  in  the  same manner as if the transfer of the property by the trustee had been made directly by the settlor himself. Where such  property  is  not  so  transferred  but  reverts  to  the settlor,  or  where  the  settlor  waives  his  right  to  a reversion  of  the  property,  and  there  is  a  subsequent transfer of such property, the cost of acquisition shall be the cost at which the settlor had acquired the said property  prior  to  its  settlement  into  the  said  trust. Subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Commissioner,  the provisions  of  this  paragraph  shall  also  be  applicable where a property is settled into a trust for the purpose of  a  commercial  transaction  not  being  a  designated commercial transaction. For the purposes of this paragraph, "designated commercial transactions"

means  the  custody  of  investment  instruments,  the establishment  or  holding  of  real  or  personal  security interests (including hypothecs, privileges, pledges and guarantees),  and  any  other  commercial  transaction which may be prescribed, while "commercial transaction"  shall  have  the  meaning  assigned  to  it  in article 2 of the Trusts and Trustees Act.

- (25) ( a ) Where a person that is authorised or not required to be so authorised to act as a trustee in terms of articles 43 and 43A of the Trusts and Trustees Act holds in its own name shares in a company on behalf of the beneficial owner of such shares, and where such person transfers or otherwise disposes of the beneficial ownership of such shares to a third party, such a transaction shall be deemed to  constitute  a  transfer  of  shares  for  the purposes of this article.
2. ( b ) Where a change in the registered holder of shares in a company does not involve a change in the beneficial ownership thereof, such change shall not be deemed to constitute a transfer of shares for the purposes of this article  provided  that  the  registered  holder  of  such shares remains a person authorised or not required to be so authorised to act as a trustee in terms of articles 43 and 43A of the Trusts and Trustees Act.
3. ( c ) For the purposes of this sub-article "beneficial owner" means a person who is the real owner of, or who is otherwise beneficially entitled to, the shares which are subscribed or held on his behalf and in his interest by a person authorised or not required to be so authorised to act as a trustee in terms of articles 43 and 43A of the Trusts and Trustees Act and "beneficial ownership" shall be construed accordingly.
4. ( d ) When  the  shares  referred  to  in  this  sub-article  are transferred either by the trustee to a person other than the settlor or by the settlor to a third party after the shares have reverted to the settlor, the acquisition cost shall be deemed to be the cost of acquisition of the shares by the settlor when the shares were originally purchased or subscribed by the settlor prior to the shares being settled into the trust.
- (26) The Minister may make regulations determining the method of calculation of capital gains in relation to transfers involving trusts and to prescribe any matter that may be prescribed in relation to such transfers.

- ( c ) Where it appears to the Commissioner that -

- ( d ) An order under this sub-article may be made not later than  six  years  from  the  end  of  the  year  in  which  the transfer is notified to the Commissioner:
- Provided that an order that is made solely on account of  the  fact  that  the  market  value  of  the  property  in question  is  higher  than  the  transfer  value  declared  in the deed -
- (i) may only be made if the declared transfer value is  less  than  eighty-five  per  cent  of  the  market value; and

- ( h ) Saving the other provisions of this article, the provisions  of  the  Income  Tax  Acts  relating  to  the collection and remission of the tax, interest  and additional  tax  shall  apply  to  any  tax,  interest  and additional  tax  due  under  this  article  as  if  the  tax,

- interest  and  additional  tax  referred  to  in  the  said provisions included also the tax, interest and additional tax chargeable and payable under this article.
- ( i ) A transferor who disagrees with an order served upon him under paragraph ( c ) shall have the same rights to object  to  that  order  and  to  appeal  from  a  decision  of the  Commissioner  refusing  that  objection  as  if  that order were an assessment issued under the Income Tax Management Act  and  the  relevant  provisions  of  that Act  relating  to  objections  and  appeals  shall  apply mutatis mutandis .

References in this sub-article to a company ceasing to be a member of a group of companies do not apply to cases where a company ceases to be a member of a group by being wound up or dissolved or in consequence of another member of the group being wound up or dissolved:

Provided that where a company ceases to be a member of the original group by being wound up or dissolved, for the purpose of determining whether the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the original group under paragraph ( b ), such company shall be deemed to have remained in existence.

- ( b ) The chargeable company shall cease to be a member of the original group, if such company and the company from which it had acquired the property referred to in paragraph  ( a ) no  longer  satisfy the  provisions  of article 5(9)(i) and (iii) and such determination shall be made by reference to the same individuals referred to in paragraph (iii) of the said article taken into account in determining whether the two companies referred to in  this  paragraph  satisfied  the  provisions  of  article 5(9)(i) and (iii) on the date of the acquisition referred to in paragraph ( a ):

Provided  that  where  the  acquisition  referred  to  in paragraph ( a ) took place before the 1st January 2010, article 5(9)(iii) shall be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether a company ceases to be a member of a group:

Provided  further  that  where  the  chargeable  company ceases to be a member of the original group, solely as a result of a change in the direct or indirect individual shareholders of the company  from  which it  had acquired the property referred to in paragraph ( a ), the

Cap. 372.

- chargeable  company  shall,  for  the  purpose  of  this paragraph, not be treated as ceasing to be a member of the  original  group  as  a  result  of  such  change,  so however that  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the original group it shall be deemed that such change had not taken place and such determination shall be made by  reference  to  the  same  individuals  referred  to  in article 5(9)(iii)  taken  into  account  in  determining whether  the  chargeable  company  and  the  company from which it had acquired the property satisfied  the provisions of article 5(9)(i) and (iii) on the date of the acquisition referred to in paragraph ( a ).
- ( c ) For  the  purpose  of  this  sub-article  the  term  "original group"  shall  mean  the  two  companies  referred  to  in paragraph  ( b ),  and  the  individual  direct  or  indirect beneficial  owners  of  the  said  companies  who  were taken into account in determining whether the provisions of article 5(9)(i) and (iii) had been satisfied on the date of the acquisition referred to in paragraph ( a ):

Provided that where the two companies referred to in paragraph  ( b )  are  directly  or  indirectly  owned  as  to eighty percent or more by a company whose securities are  listed  on  a  stock  exchange  recognised  by  the Commissioner  for  the  purpose  of  this  provision,  the term  "original  group"  shall  mean  the  two  companies referred  to  above  and  the  company  whose  securities are listed on the said stock exchange as existing on the date of the acquisition referred to in paragraph ( a ):

Provided also that where an individual acquires shares consequent  to  a  judicial  or  consensual  separation,  in terms of a  donation,  exempt  from  tax  under  the provisions of article 5(2)( e ), or a transfer causa mortis such individual shall be deemed for all the purposes of this sub-article to have held such shares from the date such shares were previously acquired in an acquisition preceding the date of the judicial or consensual separation, donation or the transfer causa mortis .

- ( d ) When the chargeable company ceases to be a member of the group it shall be treated for all the purposes of this  article  as  if,  immediately  after  its  acquisition  of the property referred to in paragraph  ( a ), it  had transferred  and  immediately  re-acquired  the  property at  that  time  and  the  transfer  value  to  be  taken  into account is the value at which the chargeable company had acquired the said property from the group company in an acquisition  to  which  sub-article  (4)( f ) applies.
- ( e ) The tax on a transfer to which this sub-article applies shall be charged at the rate of eight  percent  (8%)  of  the transfer  value  as  established  in  paragraph  ( d ):  provided

that the said rate shall be  ten  percent  (10%)  if  the acquisition of property referred to in paragraph ( c ) occurred before the 1st January, 2004.

- ( f ) Tax chargeable under this sub-article  shall  be  due  by the  chargeable  company  and  shall  be  remitted  to  the Commissioner  within  fifteen  working  days  from  the date on which such company ceases to be a member of the group as provided in paragraph ( b ).
- ( g ) Where in accordance with paragraph ( d ) the chargeable  company  is  treated  as  having  transferred and immediately reacquired the property, the tax chargeable on the deemed transfer in accordance with paragraph ( f )  shall  be  treated  as  being  due  not  by  the chargeable company but by a related company ("company A") if:
- (i) company A is incorporated in Malta;
- (ii) a joint election under this paragraph is made by the chargeable company and company A to treat the  tax  chargeable  on  the  deemed  transfer  as being due by company A;
- (iii) such joint election is made by notice given to the Commissioner  not  later  than  fifteen  working days  from  the  date  on  which  the  chargeable company ceases to be a member of the group as provided in paragraph ( b ); and
- (iv) the tax chargeable referred to in paragraph ( f ) is paid by company A within the period referred to in the said paragraph.

For the purpose of this paragraph company A is related to  the  chargeable  company  if  both  companies  form  a group for  the  purposes  of  article  5(9)  at  the  time  the original group ceases to exist.

- (12B) Where, under the provisions of article 14(1)(f) and (j) any deduction has been allowed in any year of assessment in respect of any property in ascertaining the total income of any person, and before the source of income in respect of which the deduction has been allowed has ceased to belong to the said person, any of the events set out in article 24(1) occurs in the year immediately preceding the year of assessment in the case of any such property in respect of which any deduction has been allowed as aforesaid, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, such person shall render to the Commissioner at the same time as he renders his tax return under article 10 of the Income Tax Management Act, a balancing statement in respect of the property in question in the manner set out in article 24(1) and the other sub-articles of article 24 shall apply accordingly in respect of such balancing statement. For the avoidance of doubt, any balancing charge resulting from the balancing statement shall be charged to tax at the rates applicable to the particular

Provided that where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, a series of transactions is effected with the sole or main purpose of reducing the amount of tax payable in terms of this Act by any person by reason of the operation of this provision, such a person shall be assessable as if this provision  did  not  apply  and,  for  the  purpose  of  this provision, a series of transactions shall mean any two or more  corresponding  or  circular  transactions  carried  out by  the  same  person,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  as  the case may be:

- ( b ) wound up part way through its accounting period and until  it  is  so  wound  up  satisfied  the  conditions  to  be deemed  a  member  of  the  same  group  as  another company  in  the  year  preceding  a  year  of  assessment and has the same accounting period start date as that other  company  in  that  year  preceding  the  year  of assessment,

- (2) ( a ) The gains or profits derived by the Contractor from the production of petroleum for any basis year, being the year immediately preceding a year of assessment, shall be arrived at by deducting the recoverable costs as defined in the Contract and not yet fully recovered by the Contractor, from the total of the value of the cost r e c o v e r y  p e t r o l e u m  a n d  o f  t h e  s h a r e  o f  p r o f i t petroleum, as defined in the Contract, allotted to the Contractor for that year, to which shall be added any ancillary or incidental income for the same year.
- ( b ) Where  after such deduction as is referred to in paragraph ( a ) there remains any balance of unabsorbed recoverable  costs,  the  amount  of  such  unabsorbed costs shall be carried forward to the following year and shall  be  added  to  and  become part of the recoverable costs for that year.
- ( c ) The  procedure  referred  to  in  paragraph  ( b )  shall  be followed  in  subsequent  years  until  all  recoverable costs shall have been absorbed.

- a ) For  the  purposes  of  this  article,  particularly  for  the purposes of sub-article (2), each Contract shall be deemed to constitute a separate and distinct source of income and any Contractor deriving gains or profits from more than one Contract shall be subject to tax as if  he  were  a  separate  and  unconnected person with respect to each such Contract.
- ( b ) Where more than one petroleum field is in production in an area covered by the same Contract, the gains or profits from each such field shall be determined as if each  such  field  constitutes  a  separate  and  distinct

source  of  income  arising  to  a  separate  person,  so however  that  the  Contractor  shall  have  the  right  to identify  the  fields  in  the  said  area  where  the  cost  of exploration  and  development  operations  are  to  be taken into account in determining the relative gains or profits.

- (4) The  provisions  of  articles  16  to  22  shall  not  apply  in  the case of any company in any year in which the company is operating under a licence referred to in sub-article (1).

4. ( c ) The  tax  withheld  in  accordance  with  paragraph  ( a ) shall  be  considered  as  a  final  withholding  tax  unless the sub-contractor notifies the Commissioner that this tax is to be considered as a provisional tax payment to be  credited  against  the  tax  liability  of  the  said  subcontractor's chargeable income for the relevant year of assessment computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
5. ( d ) The  notification  referred  to  in  paragraph  ( c )  shall  be made  by  not  later  than  the  tax  return  date  for  the relevant  year  of  assessment  and  in  such  form  as  the Commissioner may require.
- (6) Except  for  gains  or  profits  derived  from  the  production  of petroleum referred to in sub-articles (1) and (2), any income or deemed income derived by a Contractor and subject to tax under any of the provisions of this Act shall be so brought to charge in accordance with the said provisions and at the applicable rates, but no deduction shall be granted thereagainst in respect of any loss or outgoing expense incurred in connection with the exploration for or the production of petroleum.

24. (1) Where, under the provisions of article 14(1)( f ) and ( j ), any deduction has been allowed in any year of assessment in ascertaining  the  total  income  of  any  person  and  any  of  the following events occurs in the year immediately preceding the year of assessment in the case of any property in respect of which any deduction has been allowed as aforesaid, that is to say, either the property or any part thereof -

3. ( b ) is destroyed; or
4. ( c ) is  put  out  of  use  as  being  worn  out  or  obsolete  or otherwise useless or no longer required,

and  the  event  in  question  occurs  before  the  source  of  income  in respect of which the deduction has been allowed has ceased to exist or to belong to the said person, he shall, in the year of assessment, render  to  the  Commissioner,  at  the  same  time  as  he  renders  his return of income under article 10 of the Income Tax Management Act, a statement (hereinafter referred to as a "balancing statement"),  in  respect  of  the  property  in  question  showing  the following items, that is to say:

- (i) the  amount  of  the  capital  expenditure  on  the provision thereof; and
- (ii) the  total  depreciation  which  has  occurred  by reason  of  wear  and  tear  since  the  date  of  the acquisition of such property, taking into account the aggregate amount of all deductions previously allowed under the provisions of article 14(1)( f ) and ( j ) and of any deductions or charges previously allowed or made under subarticle (2)( a ) or ( b );
- (iii) the  amount  of  all  sale,  insurance,  salvage  or compensation  monies  in  respect  thereof  and, where  the property has been transferred  by exchange, the value thereof, or, if put out of use, the disposal value thereof.

- ( a ) the  amount  of  a  balancing  allowance  shall  be  the amount  by  which  the  amount  of  item  (i)  of  the balancing statement exceeds the sum of the amounts of item (ii) and item (iii) of that statement; or
- ( b ) the amount of the balancing charge shall be the amount by which the sum of the amounts of item (ii) and item

- (iii) of the balancing statement exceeds the amount of item (i) of that statement:

## Provided that -

- (i) the balancing charge shall in no case exceed the aggregate amount of any deductions previously allowed under the provisions of article 14(1)( f ) and ( j ) and included in item (ii) of the balancing statement;
- (ii) where the property in respect of which a balancing  allowance  falls  to  be  allowed  or  a balancing charge falls to be made was used only partly  in  the  production  of  the  income,  only  so much  of  the  balancing  allowance  that  would otherwise have been allowed, or of the balancing charge  that  would  otherwise  have  been  made shall be allowed or made as may be appropriate having  regard  to  the  extent  of  use  for  the  said purpose.
- (3) Where  property,  in  the  case  of  which  any  of  the  events mentioned in sub-article (1) has occurred, is replaced by the owner thereof and a balancing charge falls to be made on him by reason of that event or, but for the provisions of this sub-article, would have fallen to be made on him by reason thereof, then, if by notice in writing to the Commissioner he so elects, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:
- ( a ) if  the  amount  of  the  balancing  charge  which  would have been made is greater than the capital expenditure on providing the new property -
- (i) the balancing charge shall be an amount equal to the difference; and
- (ii) no balancing allowance under sub-article (2) and no deduction under article 14(1)( f ) and ( j )  shall be  made  or  allowed  in  respect  of  such  new property or the capital expenditure on the provision thereof; and
- (iii) in  considering  whether  any,  and,  if  so,  what balancing  charge  falls  to  be  made  in  respect  of the  capital  expenditure  on  providing  such  new property, the aggregate amount of all deductions, previously  allowed  in  respect  of  such  property under the provisions of this article and of article 14(1)( f ) and ( j ),  shall  be  deemed  to  be  equal  to the full amount of such expenditure;
- ( b ) if the capital expenditure on providing the  new property is equal to, or greater than the amount of the balancing charge that would have been made -
- (i) the balancing charge shall not be made; and
- (ii) the  amount  of  any  deductions  in  respect  of  the said  expenditure  under  the  provisions  of  article 14(1)( f ) and ( j )  shall  be  calculated  as  if  the

Cap. 372.

- capital expenditure on providing such  new property had been reduced by the amount of the balancing charge which would have been made; and
- (iii) in  considering  whether  any,  and,  if  so,  what balancing allowance or balancing charge falls to be made in respect of the capital expenditure on providing such new  property, the aggregate amount of all deductions, previously allowed in respect of such property under the provisions of this  article  and  under  article  14(1)( f ) and ( j ), shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  increased  by  an amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  balancing charge that would have been made:

Provided  that where  the  new  property  is only partly employed in the production of the income, only so much of the capital expenditure incurred in providing the property shall be taken into account for the purposes of this sub-article as may be appropriate having regard to the extent to which such property is wholly and exclusively employed in the production of the income.

- (4) Where any person has delivered a balancing statement, the Commissioner may -
2. ( a ) accept the statement and make a balancing allowance or balancing charge accordingly; or
3. ( b ) refuse  to  accept  the  statement  and,  to  the  best  of  his judgment,  determine  the  amount  of  the  balancing allowance  or  balancing  charge  and  make  a  balancing allowance or balancing charge accordingly.
- (5) Where a person has not delivered a balancing statement and the Commissioner is of the opinion that a balancing charge would fall to be made upon such person in respect of any such property, then the Commissioner may, according to the best of his judgment, determine the amount of such balancing charge and assess him accordingly.
- (6) Nothing  in  sub-article  (4)  and  (5)  contained  shall  prevent the decision of the Commissioner in the exercise of the power conferred upon him by those sub-articles from being questioned in an appeal in accordance with the provisions of articles 35 and 37 of the Income Tax Management Act.
- (7) For the purpose of this article -
7. ( a ) the expression "property" means plant and machinery, and premises being an industrial building or structure owned and employed by any person in the production of his income;
8. ( b ) the capital expenditure on providing any property shall be the amount which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, such property would have cost if bought in the open market at the time it was provided;
9. ( c ) the price in respect of any property sold or the value of

- any  property  otherwise  transferred  under  an  onerous title  shall  be  the  amount  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the Commissioner,  such  property  would  have  fetched  if sold or otherwise transferred under an onerous title on the open market at the time it was sold or transferred;
- ( d ) the disposal value in respect of any property which is put  out  of  use  shall  be  the  amount  which,  in  the opinion  of  the  Commissioner,  such  property  would have fetched if sold or otherwise transferred under an onerous title in the open market at the time it was put out of use.
- (8) Where in any year of assessment full effect cannot be given to any balancing allowance owing to there being no profits or gains chargeable for that year from the source of income in respect of which such allowance is claimed or owing to the profits or gains chargeable from that source being less than the allowances, then so long as the source of income in respect of which the allowance falls to be made continues to exist and to belong to the person entitled to the said allowance, the balance of such allowance shall be added to, and be deemed to from part of, the allowance, if any, for the next succeeding year of assessment, and if no such allowance falls to be made for that year, shall be deemed to constitute the allowance for that year, and so on for subsequent years of assessment.
25. For  the  purposes  of  articles  14  to  24  both  inclusive, expenses incurred in the production of, and allowable deductions given  in  respect  of,  income  derived  from  profits  which  are allocated to a taxed account must first be deducted against such income.
26. For  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  total  income  of  any person no deduction shall be allowed in respect of -
- ( a ) domestic or private expenses other than those specifically allowed by this Act;
- ( b ) any outgoings and expenses to the extent to which they are not wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the income and, in the case of gains or profits  chargeable  under  article  4(1)( b ),  not  being furthermore necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the relative employment or office;
- ( c ) any  loss,  diminution,  exhaustion  or  withdrawal  of capital, any sum employed or intended to be employed as  capital  or  any  expenditure  for  a  capital  purpose  or of  a  capital  nature  save  as  provided  in  article  14  and 23;

- ( f ) rent  of  any  premises  or  part  of  premises  not  paid  for the purpose of producing the income;
- ( g ) any payments of a voluntary nature;

person in Malta and elsewhere:

Provided that such election shall be irrevocable and shall be notified in writing to the Commissioner by not later than the 31st day of March, 1999:

For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  ( c ),  such income  shall  not  constitute  income  from  a  trade, business, profession or vocation.
- ( c ) Where an election has been made in accordance with the  provisions  of  this  sub-article,  the  trustee  of  such trust  shall  compute  the  chargeable  income  in  relation to  the  income  attributable  to  a  trust  for  the  relevant year of assessment as if such income was derived by a company  ordinarily  resident  and  domiciled  in  Malta. Tax  thereon  shall  be  charged  at  the  rate  specified  in article 56(6) and payable in the same manner applicable  to  such  companies.  Distributable  profits shall  be  allocated  in  the  same  manner  applicable  to such  companies  and  distributions  of  such  allocated profits to beneficiaries of such trust shall be treated as if  they  were  dividends  distributed  to  shareholders  of such a company.

The  trustee  shall  keep  all  records  and  submit all  returns  and  documents  to  the  Commissioner  as  is required  in  the  case  of  such  companies.  Where  the

Income  Tax  Acts  require  documents  which  are  to comply  with  the  Companies  Act,  the  trustee  shall submit  similar  documents,  certified  by  a  certified public auditor, and which are either provided for under the Trusts and Trustees Act or, in the absence of such provision, which comply as far as is possible, with the Companies Act.

Such an application may be  made  on  such  form  and  under  such  conditions  as  may  be prescribed. Where the Commissioner makes, at his discretion, such a determination -
2. (i) no deduction or exemption contemplated by this Act shall be allowable or granted in relation to the income attributable to a trust; and
3. (ii) the  said  income  shall  be  taxable  at  the  rate specified in article 56(6); and

(iii) the tax payable as provided for in this sub-article shall not be reduced whether by way of relief of double  taxation  or  otherwise,  and  no  set-off  or credit  shall  be  made  or  allowed  in  respect  of such  tax.  The  resulting  tax  shall  be  payable  by such time as may be prescribed; and
5. (iv) the trustee of such trust shall declare  such income  and  property  settled  in  trust  on  such form as may  be prescribed and no further disclosure  of  such  income  shall  be  required  by the beneficiaries of such trust; and
6. (v) no further tax shall be payable on such income.
- (3) ( a ) Where  neither  an  election  in  accordance  with  subarticle (1) nor a determination in accordance with subarticle (2) has been made the provisions of paragraphs ( b ), ( c ), ( d ) and ( e ) shall apply.
8. ( b ) In the case where -
9. (i) all  the  income attributable to a trust consists of income  either  arising  outside  Malta  or  income referred to in article 12(1)( c ); and

Income attributable to a trust allocated to beneficiaries.

- such beneficiaries, and that where the income arising outside Malta is received in Malta by the trustee of the trust,  it  shall  be  deemed  to  be  received  in  Malta  by such beneficiaries. The trustee shall notify the beneficiary of such income and shall inform him of his duties under the Income Tax Acts.
- ( c ) In  the  case  where  the  income  attributable  to  a  trust comprises solely income referred to in paragraph ( b )(i) or dividends distributed out of the profits allocated to the foreign income account or out of the profits of an international trading company which were derived by such  company  whilst  it  was  an  international  trading company, or both such income and dividends, and all the beneficiaries of such trust are persons not resident in  Malta,  and  the  trustee  of  such  trust  provides  the Commissioner  with  a  certificate  as  referred  to  in article  5(3)  of  the  Income  Tax  Management  Act,  it shall be deemed that such income does not constitute income attributable to a trust and that such income is derived directly by such beneficiaries:

Provided that the income referred to in this paragraph shall also include dividends paid out of profits allocated to any of the taxed accounts.

- ( d ) Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraphs ( b ) and  ( c ),  capital  gains  derived  in  accordance  with  the provisions  of  article  5  from  the  transfer  of  property settled in trust in the administration of such trust or in the  distribution  or  reversion  of  such  property  shall form part of the income attributable to a trust.
- ( e ) The  chargeable  income  in  relation  to  the  income attributable to a trust shall be computed as if the trust was a person that is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta but shall exclude amounts of income attributable  to  a  trust  allocated  to  beneficiaries  as determined in accordance with the provisions of subarticle (4).
- (4) For the purpose of sub-article (3)( e ) -
- ( a ) amounts of income attributable to a trust allocated to beneficiaries shall consist of -
- (i) amounts  over  which  beneficiaries  had  a  vested right in the year immediately preceding the year of assessment; and
- (ii) amounts  over  which  an  entitlement  had  been bestowed to beneficiaries other than in the manner  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (i),  and where such entitlement had been so bestowed by the  end  of  the  year  immediately  preceding  the year of assessment; and
- (iii) amounts  representing  income  attributable  to  a trust  for  the  year  of  assessment  which  were

distributed to beneficiaries by the end of the year immediately  preceding  the  year  of  assessment, and  which  amounts  do  not  form  part  of  the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii).

- ( b ) In order that the amounts referred to in paragraph ( a ) may  be  excluded  in  terms  of  sub-article  (3)( e ),  the trustee must ensure that -
- (i) the return referred  to  in  article  24A  of  the Income Tax Management Act has been submitted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  that same article; and
- (ii) he  has  furnished  the  beneficiaries  in  question with a certificate indicating, for the relative year of assessment and where applicable, the relevant amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  ( a )  on  such form and giving such additional  details  as  may be prescribed; and
- (iii) where the amounts referred to in paragraph ( a )(i) and (ii) were not distributed to the beneficiaries by the 31st March following the end of the year immediately preceding the relevant year of assessment, a payment of tax has been made on behalf of the beneficiaries equivalent to the tax which would result were the said amounts charged  to  tax  at  the  rate  specified  in  article 56(6).  Where  such  distribution  is  not  made  by the said date, this tax becomes a debt due from the relevant trustee to the Commissioner payable by not later than the 30th June following the end of the said year.  The  tax so paid shall  be available as a credit against the beneficiary's tax liability, or for a refund as the case may be, for the relevant year of assessment.
- (5) Except  as  provided  in  article  56(4),  tax  shall  be  charged upon the chargeable income in relation to the income attributable to a trust at the rate specified in article 56(6).
- (6) ( a ) Where  foreign  tax has been paid  on  the  income attributable to a trust, such tax shall be deemed to have been paid by a trustee of such trust, whether it was paid by a trustee or a beneficiary of such trust.
- ( b ) A claim for relief of double taxation with respect to the tax referred to in paragraph ( a ),  may only be made t hrough  the  provisions  of  articles  79  to  88. Any reference in these articles to a person shall, for the purposes  of  this  sub-article,  be  deemed  to  be  a reference to a trustee of a trust while any reference to income or income of a person, shall be deemed to be a reference to the income attributable to a trust.
- (7) Unless  otherwise  provided  for  in  this  article,  no  person shall be charged to further tax under this Act in respect of income attributable to a trust which has been charged to tax in accordance

- (7) Where -
2. ( a ) the  arrangements  provide,  in  relation  to  dividends  of some classes, but not in relation to dividends of other classes, that foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction  in  respect  of  dividends  is  to  be  taken  into account  in  considering  whether  any,  and  if  so  what, credit  is  to  be  given  against  income  tax  in  respect  of the dividends, and
3. ( b ) a dividend is paid which is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,

then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or  indirectly,  not  less  than  one-half  of  the  voting  power  in  the company  paying  the  dividend,  credit  shall  be  allowed  as  if  the dividend  were  a  dividend  of  a  class  in  relation  to  which  the arrangements so provide.

5. ( a ) if no tax is chargeable on the recipient in respect of the dividend, the reduction shall be an amount equal to tax on  the  gross  dividend  at  the  rate  of  double  taxation relief applicable thereto;
6. ( b ) if the rate of tax chargeable on the recipient in respect of the dividend is less than the rate of double taxation relief applicable to the dividend, the reduction shall be

an  amount  equal  to  tax  on  the  gross  dividend  at  the difference between those two rates.

- (2) For the purpose of this article -
2. ( a ) if  the  income  of  the  person  chargeable  includes  one dividend  such  as  is  mentioned  in  the  preceding  subarticle, that dividend shall be deemed to be the highest part of his total income;
3. ( b ) if  his income includes more than one such dividend a dividend  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  higher  part  of  his total income than another dividend if the net Malta rate applicable  to  the  former  dividend  is  lower  than  that applicable to the latter dividend;
4. ( c ) where tax is chargeable at different rates in respect of different  parts  of  any  such  dividend,  or  where  tax  is chargeable in respect of some  part of any  such dividend and is not chargeable in respect of some other part thereof, each part shall be deemed to be a separate dividend;
5. ( d ) the  expression  "double  taxation  relief"  has  the  same meaning as in article 59 and the expression "the rate of double taxation relief" means the rate which represents the  excess  of  the  rate  of  tax  deductible  from  the dividend over the net Malta rate applicable thereto.
79. In  this  Act  the  phrase  "unilateral  relief"  means  the  relief given pursuant to the provisions of articles 80 to 88, and in those articles the phrase "income tax" shall have the meaning attributed to it in article 77(1).
80. Unilateral relief may be available in respect of a claim for relief of double taxation where tax under this Act is computed by reference to income which:
8. ( a ) arises outside Malta; and
9. ( b ) is  subject  to  any  tax  of  a  similar  character  to  that imposed under the Income Tax Acts under the laws of a  territory  outside  Malta,  including,  in  the  case  of  a claim for relief to which article 82( a ) and ( b ) applies, tax imposed under the Income Tax Acts.

For  the  purposes  of  paragraph ( b ),  a  tax  shall  not  be prevented from being of a similar character by reason only that it is payable under the law of a province, state or other part of a country, or is levied by or on behalf of a municipality or other local body.

81. The amount of the tax referred to in article 80( b )  is  to  be allowed as a credit against the income tax chargeable in Malta in respect of the income under article 80, and the amount of the income tax so chargeable shall be reduced by the amount of the credit:

Provided always that the credit shall not be allowed against income tax for any year of assessment unless the person entitled to the income is resident in Malta or is a company registered in Malta

82. The provision concerning unilateral relief shall, where the income under article 80 includes a dividend distributed by a company not resident in Malta, hereinafter in this article referred to as "the overseas company", have effect so that tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend shall be deemed to fall under the provision of article 80( b ) and shall be taken into account in computing the credit to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend.

For the purposes of this article -

- ( a ) "tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend" shall include tax payable in respect of a  dividend distributed by a company which is related to the overseas company as specified in paragraph ( b ), hereinafter referred to in this article as "related company", where such dividend forms part of a chain of  successive  dividends  distributed  from  one  related company to another ending in the dividend received by the  person  making the claim, or on the profits out of which such dividend was distributed;

83. The  credit  given  under  article  81  shall  not  exceed  the amount which would be produced by computing the income of a person in accordance with the provisions of this Act and then charging it to income tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the income tax chargeable (before allowance of credit pursuant to article 81) on the total income of the person entitled to it, by this total income.
84. Without prejudice to the provisions of article 87, the total credit to be allowed pursuant to article 81 to a person for any year of assessment shall not exceed the total income tax payable by him for that year of assessment, less any tax payable by him for that year of assessment under the provisions of articles 40, 69 and 73.
85. In  computing  the  amount  of  the  income  for  purposes  of unilateral relief:
- ( a ) no  deduction  shall  be  allowed  in  respect  of  tax  paid and  referred  to  in  article  80( b )  in  respect  of  the income;
- ( b ) where the  income  chargeable  depends  on  the  amount received  in  Malta  the  said  amount  shall  be  increased by the appropriate amount of the tax paid and referred to in article 80( b ) in respect of the income;
- ( c ) where the income includes a dividend and, in determining  the  amount  of  credit  to  be  given  under article 81, credit is given for tax which is not chargeable  directly  or  by  deduction  under  article  82,

the  amount  of  the  income  shall  be  increased  by  the amount of that credit.

86. The provisions  of  article  85( a ) and ( b )  shall  apply  to  the computation of total income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax referred to in article 83.
87. The provisions of article 77(8), (9) and (10) and of article 78 shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to unilateral relief as they apply to double taxation relief.
88. Unilateral  relief  shall  not  be  available  to  a  person  unless that person has proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the income referred to in the provisions of article 80( a ) has borne tax under the provisions of article 80( b ) and has proved the amount of that tax.
89. (1) If  any  person  resident  in  Malta  who  has  paid,  by deduction or otherwise, or is liable to pay, tax under this Act for any year of assessment on any part of his income, proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he has paid, by deduction or otherwise, or is liable to pay, Commonwealth income tax for that year in respect of the same part of his income, he shall be entitled to relief from tax in Malta paid or payable by him on that part of his income at a rate thereon to be determined as follows:
5. ( a ) if the Commonwealth rate of tax does not exceed onehalf of the rate of tax appropriate to his case under this Act  in  Malta,  the  rate  at  which  relief  is  to  be  given shall be the Commonwealth rate of tax;
6. ( b ) in any other case the rate at which relief is to be given shall  be  half  the  rate  of  tax  appropriate  to  his  case under this Act.
- (2) If  any  person  not  resident  in  Malta  who  has  paid,  by deduction or otherwise, or is liable to pay, tax under this Act for any year of assessment on any part of his income, proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he has paid, by deduction or otherwise, or is liable to pay, Commonwealth income tax for that year of assessment in respect of the same part of his income, he shall be entitled to relief from tax paid or payable by him under this Act on that part of his income at a rate thereon to be determined as follows:
8. ( a ) if  the  Commonwealth  rate  of  tax  appropriate  to  his case does not exceed the rate of tax appropriate to his case  under  this Act,  the  rate  at  which  relief  is  to  be given shall be one-half of the Commonwealth rate of tax;
9. ( b ) if  the  Commonwealth  rate  of  tax  appropriate  to  his case  exceeds  the  rate  of  tax  appropriate  to  his  case under this Act, the rate at which relief is to be given shall be equal to the amount by which the rate of tax appropriate to his case under this Act exceeds one-half of the Commonwealth rate of tax.

investments situated outside Malta, the flat-rate foreign tax credit shall be computed on the amount receivable, after deducting any foreign tax (charged directly or by way of withholding) but before any other deductions or payments whatsoever are made.

94. (1) Where the flat-rate foreign tax credit is due in respect of the income or gains referred to in article 92, it shall be added to the said income or gains. The aggregate sum so obtained shall be the amount that is chargeable to tax.

- (3) The provisions of article 77(8), (9) and (10) and of article 78 shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to the flat-rate foreign tax credit as they apply to double taxation relief.

For the purposes of this article, a series of transactions shall mean any two or more corresponding or circular transactions carried out by the same person, either directly or indirectly, as the case may be.

## Provided that:

- ( a ) an insufficiency of funds to pay any tax due, or
- (b) when reliance is placed on any other person to perform any task, the fact of that reliance or any dilatoriness or inaccuracies on the part of the person relied upon,

shall not constitute a reasonable excuse for the purpose of this item.

5. (1) Subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  other  items  of  this Schedule, additional tax chargeable under article 56(12)( c ) for an omission from a return shall be one point five per cent (1.5%) per month of the endangered tax.

6. (1) When an omission from a return is rectified by a person by means of the delivery of a further return made in accordance with article 13 of the Income Tax Management Act before that person is notified in writing by the Commissioner, in terms of subarticle (7) of the said article, that an enquiry will be conducted into that person's tax declarations and liabilities -

- (3) The  Commissioner  shall  not  be  required  to  remit  the additional tax in accordance with item (1)( a ) if he determines the advice in question to be spurious or frivolous: provided that the Commissioner's decision under this paragraph shall be subject to review by the Administrative Review Tribunal in any appeal filed in connection with the relative assessment.
- (4) Without  prejudice  to  paragraph  (1)( a ),  the  fact  that  an omission was due to the complexity of a particular transaction or to the complexity of any particular provision of the law shall not, of itself,  be  considered  as  a  valid  ground  for  the  remission  of additional tax under paragraph (1)( b ).
9. The additional tax chargeable under article 56(12)( c ) shall be in addition and without prejudice to interest chargeable under article 44(2A) of the Income Tax Management Act, but no such interest shall be charged on the said additional tax.

11. When  a  person  to  whom  article  12  of  the  Income  Tax Management Act applies files a declaration prescribed for the making of an election under that article after the date prescribed therefor, he shall for the purposes of article 56(12)( c ) and of this Schedule be deemed to have made a default in furnishing a return and that default shall continue until a return is furnished.
12. (1) When the Commissioner, having determined the amount of tax payable by a person for a year or years of assessment on the basis of an estimate made under article 31(3) of the Income Tax Management Act, gives notice in writing to that person, in terms of article 13(7) of that Act, that an enquiry will be conducted i n t o  h i s  t a x  d e c l a r a t i o n s  a n d  l i a b i l i t i e s ,  a n d  t h a t  p e r s o n subsequently furnishes a return of income in respect of the said year  or  years, that  person  shall  be  deemed  to  be  subject  to additional tax for an omission in addition to any additional tax to which he may be liable for a default.
- (2) For  the  purposes  of  calculating  the  endangered  tax  for  an omission to which the person referred to in paragraph (1) shall be subject, the said endangered tax shall be considered to be equal to the tax calculated on the total income, deducting therefrom any credits, as declared in the said return.
- (3) Where an assessment or an additional assessment for a year or years of assessment is made under article 31(5) of the Income Tax Management Act on a person referred to in paragraph (1), for the purposes of calculating the endangered tax, the tax calculated on the total income, deducting therefrom any credits, as declared in

the said return, shall be considered to be zero:

Provided  that  the  additional  tax  for  omission  as  resulting from paragraph (2) shall be deducted from the amount of the additional tax as resulting from this paragraph.

13. (1) The  Commissioner  may  remit  such  part  or  all  of  the additional  tax  otherwise  chargeable  in  accordance  with  this Schedule in respect of a default or an omission as he may deem fit.
- (2) The Commissioner may impose any condition that he may consider  appropriate  for  any  remission  under  paragraph  (1), including the requirement that the person concerned shall not make another  default  or  omission  within  such  period  as  the Commissioner may establish or that the said person shall make a payment  of  tax in  such  amount  and  within  such  time  as  the Commissioner may determine.
- (3) Should  any  condition  imposed  by  the  Commissioner  in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) be infringed by the person concerned, any reduction of additional tax granted by the Commissioner in addition to the reductions contemplated by the other provisions of this Schedule shall be forfeited.
- (4) If  forfeiture  is  due  under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  (3), any additional reduction made under the provisions of this item, but not under the provisions of the other items, shall be deemed to have been a suspension of liability to the said additional tax, and not the cancellation of the relevant additional tax.
- (5) The  Commissioner  shall  communicate  in  writing  to  the person concerned any condition imposed under paragraph (2), the consequences  of  an  infringement  of  any  such  condition  in accordance with paragraph (3) and, when such is the case, the fact that forfeiture has been incurred.
- (6) The  use  of  the  Commissioner's  discretion  under  this  item shall not be questioned in any appeal.
