You are helping extract Malta law articles from legislation.mt for a legal RAG system.

TASK: Identify and format articles from the provided legal text.

RULES FOR IDENTIFYING ARTICLES:
1. ARTICLE = A number followed by a period (e.g., "15.", "320.", "1234.")
   - The number is usually in BOLD in the source
   - Must be just a number + period (not "CAP.540" or other prefixes)
   - Example: "15." is an article, "CAP.540.]" is NOT

2. SUB-ARTICLE = A number in parentheses (e.g., "(1)", "(2)", "(a)", "(b)")
   - Always belongs to the preceding article
   - Can be nested: "(1)" can contain "(a)", "(b)", etc.
   - Example: "15.(1)" means Article 15, sub-article 1

3. ARTICLE vs SUB-ARTICLE EXAMPLES:
   - "15." ← ARTICLE (number + period)
   - "(1)" ← SUB-ARTICLE (number in parentheses)
   - "15.(1)" ← Article 15, sub-article 1
   - "(a)" ← SUB-ARTICLE nested under a numbered sub-article

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each article or related group of articles, output EXACTLY like this:

---
ACT: [Name of the Act]
CITATION: [Act Name Cap. X, Article Y-Z]
ARTICLES: [Article number(s)]
TOPIC: [Brief description of what this covers]
---

[Full text of article(s) exactly as written, including all sub-articles]

---

GROUPING RULES:
- If 2-4 sequential articles share the same topic → GROUP them together
- If an article is standalone or different topic → SEPARATE chunk
- Each article MUST include ALL its sub-articles
- Target: 150-400 tokens per group

EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
